"After what transpired yesterday banning x links makes sense, sure.

Just as someone who has never used twitter and has no intention to ever use twitter, I would support banning twitter links regardless of Musk's NAZI hooliganism. 

The links are often inaccessible, and the content is usually covered somewhere else more robustly.

Yes, Musk is a dangerous idiot, and yes I'd support no longer accepting twitter links for that reasons. But also, let's ban twitter links because they aren't (often) accessible to those without twitter and there are better sources we should be giving space to.

# SCREW WRITING MY THESIS IM GETTING DRUNK,2015-09-30,19:29
"I have been following the Jays for as long as I can remember.  Although I was around during 92 and 93, I don't have many strong memories of that time frame.  My earliest 'strong' memories were of the Rogers Clemens years.

I fell in love with players like Darrin Fletcher, Shawn Green, and of course, Carlos Delgado, arguably the best player to ever don the Blue &amp; White.

I've sat through rebuild after rebuild, GM after GM, manager after manager, injury after injury, and Broken promise after broken promise.

Yet when AA took over, somehow it just...felt different.  I felt like I knew he was going to be the one to turn it around.  I believe in him, and I knew what he was doing was right.  I staunchly defended him while others derided him for his lack of moves, or trading prospects away. 

There are many facets to making everything come together, but it all started with AA and his belief in making the right move, not any move.

And however sweet this feels for us, it feels that much better for everyone on the field.

Ladies and Gentlemen, to the AL East.

***Raises glass***",2015-09-30,19:25
"Remember when we were .500 after 100 games?

Remember when we had the offense but could never break through?

Remember the days Tulo and Price came to town?

Remember the 11 game streak?

Remember being wildcard #2...then 1...then taking the division lead?

Today trumps them all. And everything else, until the Series is ours!

###WE DID IT REDDIT,2015-09-30,19:30
"Been a fan for 30 years. It's amazing to think back to all the teams who were good but not good enough in the AL East. Thinking back to a few years ago when we make this blockbuster deal with the Marlins, we trade for Dickey who has just won a Cy Young and how much hope there was and then things just never got going and it seemed like we were once again going to have to play out the team we had and start again. To not only be a playoff team in such a short time after that deflating season but to have won the Pennant and maybe even the AL itself is crazy. All the guys deserve all the credit in the world they played like a team, they all helped, they all picked each other up. 

Big shoutout to AA who has been a godsend since he came to us, especially after Riccardi. I think AA took a lot of unnecessary heat last year over the deadline and I think we see this year that he deserves some patience because he's got a plan. Hopefully Rogers lets him and Shapiro be as great as they can be and this is the last time we miss the playoffs for two straight decades. Very proud of all the guys top to bottom. Let's win this shit.",2015-09-30,19:31

I know my old hand mixer is due to be replaced soon (which was only $30 and has lasted about 3 years), but someone who does a high amount of cooking and moderate amount of baking, I can certainly see the appeal in one, but is it really good long term for the kitchen?  ",2016-04-26,12:35
Mods please stickie this I'm sick of this question coming up all the time in other threads ,2016-04-26,13:43
Let's upvote the shit out of this so /r/baseball will get really confused when they do the weekly state of the subreddit post,2016-04-26,15:02
"Is...this post in the right place?  Have I missed something??

You know what...fuck it.

YES, they are awesome mixers but like you said, IF you do a good amount of baking, and have attachments for cooking.  THAT said, you can very often find them on sale at a pretty decent deal, say around $200 - $300 or less depending on the model (like if you don't go for one of the professional series ones.)  So if you wait for a good sale (say, Black Friday or boxing week), and do a moderate amount of baking, it's pretty worth it.  In fact, for the long haul, if you do only a light amount of baking, it is also worth it.  Because then you have it, and when you want to make pancakes, cakes, cupcakes or cookies or *whatever*, you have it, you whip it out, it does a fantastic job for you, then goes back into storage, waiting to be used again.

Future Shop used to have a sale on the mixers plus their attachments every year (attachments were like 50% off), that coincided with an annual rebate period KitchenAid would have for the mixers and attachments.  So you could get one of the mixers on sale and a few attachments, and get another $50 or so back in rebates.  RIP Future Shop.  I'm not sure if Best Buy has continued the tradition or not.

Or look for clearance sales at places like Costco.ca, and you may find one being discontinued massively discounted.  I got a pretty decent one, middle of the road in their model lineup, on clearance for over 50% off, so it was under $200, a few years ago.  It's rock solid, but, it also only gets light usage.

Back before the 2000's (not sure about 2000's themselves) all models used to be made with metal gears.  Now they are made with a heavy plastic (not sure about the pro series).  This was a point of issue for people who had their mixers for like 30 - 40 years, and were disappointed when replacing them.  However, if you are not a heavy duty baker, then this probably won't be an issue for you ever. 

ATTACHMENTS

I have the ice cream maker and pasta roller attachments.  Both are pretty wicked.  Back when I used to have more time, I loved making home made pasta.  Fresh home made pasta is damned delicious.  And the texture is so nice.  Puts packaged pasta to shame.  I envy people who have their nonna living with them.  

Home made ice cream is also amazing.  Right when you finish making it, you basically have soft serve ice cream and it's so damn good (the more cream the merrier).  Then you put it in the freezer, and it's more like regular ice cream again...but if you take it out and let it sit for 5 minutes, it's back to being like soft serve again.  Mmmmm....  Also being able to make your own flavours is very cool.  Made pumpkin ice cream around thanksgiving a few times...wow.


Also, if this was a shitpost...then....damn you.

If it wasn't, then, I hope this helped!

[Edit]  And just like that, Lowe's has one on sale for 50% off right now, to match our home uniforms!  It's a six hour flash sale,  $199.99 down from $399.99

"I think you need to do a rough calculations of how many hours per week you spend mixing. From there - extrapolate how much time you spend mixing in a given year. Once you know how many hours you will likely spend mixing then you can calculate - based on the warranty of the machine - your exact dollar per hour spent mixing. 

With that data in hand your could potentially cross-reference against other competing off-brand mixers, and judge whether you would indeed get value from that type of item as opposed to a Kitchenaid. 

If you're working in the kitchen for seven months a year and baking moderately then you may not need to spend as much money on a high end item. If you're going to be baking at a high level for 9 months of the year then maybe it's worth investing in your kitchen items.

Having said that, do you need the latest model? Absolutely not.  Do they ever go on sale?  They absolutely do.  Are they generally over priced?  They generally are ... But not if you spread it over the length of the years you will use it.

Having said that if the quality of your instruments and tools don't matter as much then you probably have the answer you need.
",2016-04-26,13:15
"Kitchenaid Stand Mixers are pricey, but I think they're worth it.  

With your old hand mixer on it's way out, and no replacement in sight, now is the time to make a splash on the free agent market and add a top-end mixer to your baking line up.   Some people may agree with Paul Beeston and prefer not to hand out long term deals, but I like the idea of locking down a mixer like the Kitchenaid Stand Mixer for 10+ years, even if it does cost $500.  

I'm not a numbers expert, but I'd expect you to be able to get 8-10 DAR (Desserts Above Replacement) for at least your first 5 years with the mixer.  Numbers may start to decline slowly after that, but the mixer should preform well even into the late stages of it's career.  

I know these mixers come in a variety of colours, but I'd suggest something neutral.  If you're faced with a complete kitchen rebuild in the coming years, you'd want the Kitchenaid mixer to fit in with it's new surroundings.  The trade market will be limited for a big ticket item like this.

With zero knowledge of how they work I pulled it apart, found the broken bit, ordered a new bit off of Kitchenaid for the low, low price of $30, put it back together, and it's as good as new. That's exactly what you want in a product, simple and reliable so they'll run for ages without issue, but then easy to fix and get parts for if something does go wrong. And they still build them exactly the same way, so I can feel confident that if something else breaks in another 10 years, I'll be able to get the part and fix it.

It gets used multiple times per week, sometimes very heavy use on weekends when we're cooking up a storm of things to freeze for weekday dinners. 

We have the pasta attachment, used a few dozen times, a vegetable strainer that i've never seen get used, and a meat grinder that I got recently and kind of love using.  (Buy a big cheap beef shoulder roast, cut into cubes, freeze for a few minutes, and grind it up with some salt+pepper and a bit of chopped up raw bacon, best burgers you'll ever eat.)

It's sat in a prime counter location since we got it, the attachments sit on shelves in their original boxes, pulled out as needed.  

Literally every other appliance in our kitchen has been replaced since we got it.  Fridge, stove, toaster, waffle iron, the effing phone, the old crock pot, friggen everything died, but the Kitchenaid keeps on truckin.  ",2016-04-27,10:35

Let's Go Jays!!!,2022-10-04,12:51
"My predictions for Jays starters in the wildcard series:

Game 1: Manoah
Game 2: Gausman
Game 3: Stripling

ALDS (if Jays sweep):

Game 1: Stripling
Game 2: Manoah
Game 3: Gausman
Game 4: Stripling
Game 5: Manoah (4 days rest)

ALDS (if Jays win WC series in 3):

Game 1: Berrios
Game 2: Manoah
Game 3: Gausman
Game 4: Stripling
Game 5: Manoah (4 days rest)

Maybe I'm wrong regarding how the team feels about Berrios, but I certainly wouldn't want him starting Game 5 (if necessary).",2022-10-04,13:21

Never in doubt. Great derby overall. Nice for Julio to set a record in his home park. Nicer to knock him out in the semis. I wanted to see Randy take some cuts in his cowboy boots.,2023-07-11,02:54
"Do they usually make the winner of the 2nd semi finals go back to back like that? Arozarena  had a lot of time to rest between hitting. Which makes me wonder if it's a bad thing to wait so long and cool off. 

Congrats to Valddy. I hope this flipped a switch and he has a monster second half of the season.",2023-07-11,07:29
"Congratulations, Vlad! Now both father and son have a Home Run Derby title.

Anyone who complains about Vlad not hitting enough home runs in regular games, given his derby power, deserves to be whacked upside the head and shoulders with a paperback copy of ""The Last Out"" by Buck Martinez (published in 1987).",2023-07-11,07:40
"I don't get why they don't use a pitching machine. Vladdy's success is partly due to John's feeds, but Pete Alonso got kind of screwed by Murphy's inconsistent pitching.

Why not use a pitching machine and make it 100% the same for everyone?",2023-07-11,08:52
"I know we‚Äôve talked about Vlad underperforming his peripherals this season but the difference is more than I realized. 

By wOBA, Vlad is at .342. That ranks 61st out of 150 qualifiers (Bo is 25th at .362). But xwOBA, which considers exit velocity, launch angle and yes, even sprint speed, Vlad is FIFTH in all of MLB. Second in the AL behind Ohtani.

That‚Äôs right, if not for batter ball luck, you could argue Vlad has been the second best hitter in the AL this year.

The difference of 53 points from xwOBA or wOBA is second in all of MLB (Keibert Ruiz is 59 points, if you‚Äôre looking for fantasy buy-low guys). There are several guys in the 35-point range and includes power hitters like Alonso, Suarez, Bell and Devers and speedier guys like Reynolds, Tim Anderson Witt and Acuna. Vladito is going to have a MONSTER second half!",2023-07-11,10:33

Assuming there's no tissue damage, a cracked bone should heal pretty fast (I have some personal experience with this). And considering that Tulo wasn't exactly hitting off the charts, a break might actually do him some good.

"Probably the most crazy superstitious day ever for me as a baseball fan.

I'm not usually superstitious but while watching Game 1, I just couldn't shake the feeling that I *knew* the Jays would win if I just stopped watching. They were down 7-2, I had some stuff to do so I turned off the TV and went to my PC. Within moments I saw the Jays were now at 5 runs so I just left it be. A few times I'd see the Jays get people on base so I caved a few times and flipped the game on and I'd immediately see the rally killed. I decided to just stay away. The Jays eventually came back to win 11-10.

For Game 2, I had the opposite feeling. I felt like I *needed* to watch for them to win. I went back to the living room, laid down and got comfortable. Suddenly, the fire alarm goes off in my building. Normally I ignore it because we usually get a lot of false alarms but within moments we could hear people shouting from downstairs outside that there's a fire and people need to get out.

Me and my wife run downstairs and pretty much just wait around with the other tenants while the fire trucks come in and battle the fire. When the firemen finally start wrapping up their equipment and the stress is down, I pop open my at-bat app to see the Jays are being no hit. So I say screw it, top of the order coming up. I turn on MLB.TV and about 30 seconds later, Vladdy breaks up the no-hitter. I've been watching since.

"Since some guy in the ""post your unpopular opinion"" thread took the assignment to heart and said some truly wild stuff about Dan Shulman, I want to set things right with the universe. 

That we, as Blue Jays fans, get to hear Dan Shulman call every game is nothing short of a gift from god. He is truly one of the best baseball play-by-play guys to ever do it and here he is, calling Jays games every night! Because he wants to! 

I've spent an awful lot of time listening to a lot of out-of-town baseball broadcasts in my life and Shulman is in the inner circle of the greats. As a bonus, his passion for the Blue Jays is palpable without becoming an irritating homer. 

He knows the game and knows the job and has a keen sense of the moment. He's the best and we're lucky to have him. Like everyone, I'm glad Buck is back but listening to Shulman every night, or just on the Jays broadcasts in general, is the best.",2022-07-26,10:01
"Dan Shulman is a treasure, we are lucky to have him, he brings out the best commentary in his colleagues, and I am down to fight anyone who says otherwise.",2022-07-26,10:04
"If you ever don't appreciate our broadcast team, just try listening in on the broadcasts of basically any other team. They are all pretty awful.",2022-07-26,10:34
"if you've ever listened to any other team's broadcast you'll know how lucky we are to have the crew we do. 

Dan is excellent at his job, the stats peppered through the entire broadcast are amazing for even the most hardcore of fans, and the energy levels are unmatched. Personally my favourite part of the whole thing is that the Jays broadcast team seems to give a very fair assessment and a LOT of airtime to the other team's players - lots of background on the opposition in a fair and balanced way. Almost no other broadcast I've listened to does that. 

Kudos to everyone involved in getting them on the air and supporting the broadcast, it's always very high quality.",2022-07-26,10:22

&amp;#x200B;

guys main complaint is that dan is too professional. lol. for the record, I love the way the guy calls games. i also find he is pretty decent at slipping in casual conversation, but his voice is so damn perfect it still just sounds very professional .",2022-07-26,16:03
"We‚Äôre so lucky. I try and watch other team games and often I end up turning it off because the broadcast teams are so bad. 

There is a real common trend I notice where the people calling the game seem to not like baseball. They‚Äôre constantly on about ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong‚Äù or ‚Äúhow it used to be.‚Äù 

Dan is seriously the goat. He makes Tabler listenable.",2022-07-26,10:30
Since when are people ripping on Dan?,2022-07-26,10:12
"Any game with Tabler calling is just one long list of innuendos and double entendres. If you made a drinking game out of how many comments he makes along the lines of 'I was in the locker room and they were going hard', you'd have blood alcohol poisoning by the 4th inning. Guy just can't stop.

Dan and Buck. Best combo in BB.",2022-07-26,10:46
"Jays broadcasts are one of the few where they stay on topic for most of the game.  

So many play by play teams start rambling on about old players, the state of the league, the rules about the shift, start interviewing random people and just go off on tangents in the middle innings and ignore the fact that there's still a baseball game going on.

Jays broadcasts stay on topic for the most part.  Any dead space between plays is usually talking about a roster player's performance, up and coming players in the organization, interesting statistics, good insight about the batter's stance or the way they approach the at-bat, even guessing what pitch is coming and getting it right more often than not.

It's clear they're passionate about the game and they're not stuck in the past like a lot of ex-player broadcasters are.",2022-07-26,10:47
I grew up in Toronto but left in ‚Äò94 to work in the US. I‚Äôve watched a lot of Sunday night baseball on ESPN over the years. Because of Amazon prime I have access to MLB games and started watching the Jays again (they are had to follow in the US). I recognized Dan‚Äôs voice. Holy cow! We have THE voice of Sunday night baseball calling Jays games!?! The dude is so pro! Lucky!?  Heck yeah. It‚Äôs a pleasure to hear him call a game.,2022-07-26,11:02
Dan Shulman is by far the best play by play announcer!  Jays are lucky.  I guess he will be back to spot duty?,2022-07-26,11:47
His calls on all the Red Sox follies this past week were so great!,2022-07-26,12:03
Shulman is awesome. Rogers needs to lock him up. Can‚Äôt let him get away again,2022-07-26,12:06
how the hell can anyone say anything negative about him? hes so engaging to listen to and him and pat hit it off better than anyone ive heard. im new to watching the jays regularly so idk the history of buck as an announcer,2022-07-26,12:42
"Who the fuck is talking shit about Dan Shulman? Guy is a legend and as Blue Jays fans we're lucky to have him call games for us.

I think we're absolutely spoiled to have Dan, Buck and Tabby on the Jays broadcast. An absolute joy every time.",2022-07-26,13:01
Dan is a certified beauty. Love the entire broadcast team.,2022-07-26,10:16
People don‚Äôt like Dan?? Madness. Dan is great.,2022-07-26,10:34
"I really miss Buck, he's great missing the play calling this year without him. Dan and the team have been really stellar in his absence. It's been pretty evident in watching highlights from other teams. The most recent example I can think of is Bostons play by play when their pitcher balked twice. The Jays team was on it, saying what he should have done and noticing when it was finally corrected, or how a play should have been done. I didn't even notice the difference until I watched the Boston feed later, and they just seemed zoned out. There's these outside plays that come up that the Jays broadcasting team has always done a good job with teaching me new things. They all do a great job.",2022-07-26,11:03
Well said Drew!,2022-07-26,10:20
"I wholeheartedly agree. Dan is a treasure and we‚Äôre so lucky to have him, he really does bring out the best in whoever he‚Äôs with. That takes an immense amount of skill, and probably natural talent as well. He‚Äôs amazing.",2022-07-26,10:27
"We're spoiled for sure, especially when you listen to other (US) markets; or even NHL broadcasts.",2022-07-26,10:29
I like that Dan is gracious - it‚Äôs so refreshing not to have a know-it-all. He asks interesting questions of his broadcasting partner and gets great insight,2022-07-26,10:33
"I met Dan Shulman at a hockey rink in the gta once, was chatting with other parents but still was super nice to me when I went up and asked for a picture. We‚Äôve got a good one in dan.",2022-07-26,10:36

"Just chiming in here to say that I really appreciate the Blue Jays announcers more now that I‚Äôve also been listening/watching Yankees games (wife‚Äôs favorite team.) 

Not just because I‚Äôm a life long fan, but the Jays genuinely have the best coverage during games.",2022-07-26,12:45
"Agreed.

I had the fun of hearing a couple of other broadcasts last night (what is this day off nonsense???)

yikes.

no inflection, no enthusiasm, nothing.  Just bland, boring yammering that I didn't even bother listening to.",2022-07-26,12:57
"Nothing much to say but GOAT (at least in Canada). 

Have you guys heard him yo NCAA during march madness? Doesnt work as well bcuz of his pace and rhythm. He‚Äôs a natural baseball announcer.",2022-07-26,13:52
"All you have to do is watch a few games from other teams/networks and you'll be happy we have Dan/Pat/Buck.  I have turned games off because the announcers have just been trash, thankfully the worst that happens with our guys is I go ""no shit Pat, for fucks sake"" every once in a while.",2022-07-26,14:19
I can not agree with you more! An extremely intelligent man!,2022-07-26,15:49
Absolutely,2022-07-26,16:21

"I was wondering where that BS post came from. Didn't know it was a guy trolling the unpopular opinions thread. I agree wholeheartedly. Dan has been fantastic to listen to. I am glad we have him, but I cannot wait for more ""Get up Ball Get Ball Get OUTTA HERE!"" from Buck. I feel like Vladdy has been waiting for him to return to start hitting moonshots again.",2022-07-26,10:07
"very much agree.  Watched Sox v Cle last night (Cle broadcast team), not bad but no comparison to Dan.",2022-07-26,10:32
"If someone has a negative opinion of Dan Shulman, i don‚Äôt care what they think about literally anything else",2022-07-26,17:00
"Yeah our broadcast booth guys are great. Perfect voices for it. Could they be better as far as game insights go? Sure. But 9 innings 180 games, they can't be insightful every single time they speak. I'd be happy putting our boys up against any others in the league.",2022-07-26,13:38
"Dan is far and away the best PBP guy in the business. However, Buck and Pat are just too serious. They lack senses of humour. Dan needs a side kick that is a knowledgeable colour commentator but is able to joke around as well. I wish Buck all the best in his recovery.",2022-07-26,19:57
"When I cant watch the Jays broadcast it makes me sad, I had to watch the whole last game of the Boston series listening to those homers",2022-07-26,10:41
The jays announcers are annoying until‚Ä¶ I listen to anyone else. Just back from Florida and was forced to listen to the rays team‚Ä¶ yikes!,2022-07-26,19:26
Matt Devlin is the greatest Blue Jays PBP of all time.,2022-07-26,20:41
"Hahahaha, WOW!  Adoring shulman fans, hahaha.  I thought those people would include immediate family and end there.  I was wrong.  Even with the sound almost off, listening to this sap blather on what Berrios is thinking on a 3-2 pitch, or what Springer is thinking with runners on first and second, is nauseating. Rather, it removes from the enjoyment one could have, had he chosen not to open his maw.  Good grief.  Sweetie, call balls and strikes, period.  Leave the rest to the fellas that actually played the game, and don't drone on endlessly about the most mindless drivel.  Aye yi.  The combination of Buck and Tabby is one that, A. Should never be tampered with, B.  Proves that men that played in the majors have a prior knowledge after having played the game, vs. y'know, watching from the stands, and therefore their insight into each play is milked from prior MLB experiences. 
Beyond their baseball background and knowledge, their ability to commentate live is virtually flawless and typically anecdotal. With B &amp; T, it was an enjoyable experience watching the Jays play, now, there's a baseball game on.",2022-08-25,17:06
I always looked forward to the games he commentated. Hes the man! Dan and Pat are my favourite combination,2022-07-26,12:04
You‚Äôre 100% right Drew. It‚Äôs even tough watching Sunday Night Baseball now that Dan isn‚Äôt doing the play by play.,2022-07-26,12:21
Dan is baseball‚Äôs version of Bob Cole.,2022-07-26,12:28
Dan is truly a blessing for us all. I really hope everybody appreciates how great he really is.,2022-07-26,12:29
"If Dan is on the mic, I am guaranteed to laugh at least twice during a broadcast. Dude is like part-comedian inconspicuously going through his routine while the rest of the world thinks he's just commentating on a baseball game. He is the best of any sports broadcasts I regularly watch.

All of our guys have their strengths. Pat's had some much more shrewd insights the last couple years. He gets more seasoned as time goes on.

And Buck...a national treasure and he's not even Canadian! So stoked to hear him on our TVs tonight. :)

Love our Blue Jays broadcast team!",2022-07-26,12:36
I didn‚Äôt really appreciate Dan until I listened to other team‚Äôs broadcasts,2022-07-26,12:40
Dan Shulman is better than Tom Cheek.,2022-07-26,12:41
Ya he rocks!,2022-07-26,12:57
"All you have to do is listen to pretty much any other set of pbp/cc guys out there. Some say nothing, some say lots but not about the game you're watching, some try to be comedians...etc. Whichever combo does the Jays games, they are head and shoulders above the rest. I'm astounded at the difference, at least from what I've seen/heard of what else is out there.",2022-07-26,13:01
If there are people that don't like Dan Schulman I never want to meet them. They seem like terrible people.,2022-07-26,13:13
"Him, buck &amp; tabby all together is exceptional every time",2022-07-26,13:21
I often watch a lot of out of town broadcasts and can objectively state that we're spoiled to have Buck and Dan.,2022-07-26,13:58
Dan is an excellent commentator. My only thing is that I grew to love Buck Martinez homerun calls and it just feels off when Buck doesnt call homeruns. Nothing but respect for Dan tho.,2022-07-26,13:59
"Dan and Buck combine as the best team the Jays have had in the time I have been watching (back to the mid80s).

A great pbp guy and a great colour guy.

Buck and Pat is one of the worst. Buck is playing AWAY from his strengths and Pat just isn't very good.",2022-07-26,14:24
Praise be!,2022-07-26,14:46
Dan Shulman is amongst the best in the game. I've also met him and he is a really guy.,2022-07-26,14:49
The most calming voice in baseball,2022-07-26,15:26
i hope he's around for a very long time. like a HoF level broadcaster.,2022-07-26,15:43
When they first announced Dan was gonna be doing some Jays games I was over joyed. He has always been one of my favorites. With the Buck being out and Dan doing extra games I think we have saw that Dan made Pat better than he has ever been. Pat has not always been my favorite but in this year I have grown to appreciate Pat a lot and that has to do with Dan engaging him in casual none game related conversations through the game.,2022-07-26,17:30
"I have [MLB.tv](https://MLB.tv) and watch a lot of other games. The only other commentator that I have found that is in the same league as Dan is Joe Davis, Orel Hershiser is also really good with him. I also like Michael Kay but would put him behind Dan and Joe Davis personally.",2022-07-26,17:45
"Once I watched the yankees broadcast, and thought to myself ""this is awful"". Later I watched a Boston game and thought, ""my God this broadcast sucks"". Watched the Marlins, Nationals, White-Sox, Dodgers,... All pretty bad. And that was when I realized, ""these broadcasts aren't bad, ours is just really good"".

Dan Shulman is one of only a few who don't sound boring.",2022-07-26,17:54
I remember him when he was an on air guy at The Fan590. He was great thrn and he is truly great doing pbp.,2022-07-26,17:58
"The craziest thing is baseball isnt even his main gig, hes a college basketball savant. Truly a canadian treasure",2022-07-26,18:40
"Years ago I went on a 2 week vacation to England.  Got so used to hearing the British accent I started speaking with it myself.

I'd hear the American accent on TV every now and then, but it wasn't until I got back home and heard Dan Shulman that I knew I was in *Toronto.*  It's hard to hear when you're living in it each day, but you can tell he was born here.",2022-07-26,19:06
I absolutely love it when Dan is a guest on the radio and they talk baseball. He's very in tune with everything and it's always great insight.,2022-07-26,21:32
"100 great voice, great balance with Tabby. Knows the game but acknowledges Tabby‚Äôs first hand knowledge. Classy, and in tune with what‚Äôs happening on the field. Welcome back, Buck but Dan don‚Äôt go anywhere!!",2022-07-26,21:55
Nobody in the Jays organization is better at their position relative to their peers than Dan Shulman is.,2022-07-26,22:00
"Dan is fantastic .Jays fans have actually been quite spoiled with great broadcasters ,",2022-07-27,00:13
Sometimes at work I can only get an away stream and when listenining to other teams broadcasts you really appreciate how spoiled we are.,2022-07-27,06:45
"The Jays have had so many good PBP guys over the years...  Dan, Jim Hughson, Rod Black, even Mr. Olympics Brian Williams called games and was good...  not to mention Tom and Jerry on the radio...  I'll always think of Buck as a colour guy...  but other than Buck and to a lesser extent Tabby our colour guys have been varied, though I did like John Cerutti when he was colour for CBC... its a shame he died so young and not long into his broadcasting career.  I do like Siddall as well, he has great technical knowledge, I like him on the desk and the few games he's done this year have been good but with Tabby and Buck in the fold, Im not sure he will get an extended shot anytime soon...",2022-07-27,07:27
If you don‚Äôt appreciate Dan you‚Äôre one of the those people who complain about things just to complain. He‚Äôs widely considered one of the best play-by-play guys in North American sports.,2022-07-27,10:22
"Love me some Dan Shulman, whether he's calling Major League Baseball, College Basketball, or Canada basketball games I find he's concise, easy to listen to, and doesn't come off as elitist or a know-it-all",2022-07-27,19:15

"In all seriousness why is everyone jumping aboard the fuck the Tribe train? There was zero heat going into our series with them and zero heat afterwards.

"Today the Jays lost one of their biggest and oldest fans. My dad had tickets to the very first game they ever played, and you could probably count on one hand the number of games he's missed since. He took me to so many games when I was a kid, and coached me and numerous teams to championships. Taught me everything about playing the right way...in baseball and in life.  

He's the only person in my life that I could talk about the Jays with, and I am lost beyond measure.  He was a little over a week shy of his 89th birthday, and cancer took him in a matter of days.     

Dad's greatest pleasures were baseball and a cold beer. If you're celebrating the win tonight, please pour one out for him . üíô    

ETA: thank you so much to everyone who has responded to this thread. It really means a great deal. Last night I needed to feel a stable connection that wasn't to my family, because they're as shell-shocked as I am. You all provided me that. Very grateful.    

Go Jays go! üíô",2023-06-24,18:58
Sorry for your loss.  I know how difficult it is. I recently lost my dad too. He took me to my first game and instilled the love of the Jays in me.,2023-06-24,19:06

"Sorry for your loss. 

I actually became a jays fan after I lost my mom two years ago. Dad and I watched pretty much everything there was to watch on TV, and had no idea what to watch next. 

Put on the Jays game, and they beat the Red Sox. Next day, same thing. Soon enough every morning dad would wake up and ask when the jays were playing. We‚Äôve watched almost every game since. Even if I‚Äôm at work, I watch it on my phone and we text back and forth. 

We each have favourite players. Inside jokes. It‚Äôs been real nice. 

Glad you were able to share the same thing, and I‚Äôm hoping the jays can continue to provide you with happiness and fond memories.",2023-06-24,21:32

"Sorry for your loss -- My Dad is in his mid-80s and also instilled a love of baseball (among other sports in me) - we went to lots of games since 77 and now I am still very fortunate to take him to games with me as he did for me when I was younger - age is setting in and he's slowing down a bit but compared to most he's still fighting it and he even played slo-pitch with me and my brother until about age 80 (!) - he was a hero to many in our little slo-pitch league (and many people commented to me privately how they wish they could have done that with their dad).  

Just to offer a small ray of hope in this dark time - last night my wife took a picture (unbeknown to me until later on that evening) of my daughter leaning on my shoulder talking to me about something during the slo-pitch game last night - like I used to do with my Dad....she finally agreed to play with me this year on our silly little team, and it's always been my dream to pass on the things that I did with my Dad, to my own children -- not sure if that is your situation or not (if you have kids or nieces and nephews), but even if it isn't, simply getting involved in youth sports, and passing on the wisdom and love of the game that your dad gave to you is a wonderful way to carry on his legacy.....",2023-06-26,10:01

"Thank you Buck for being the voice of the Toronto Blue Jays for 35 years.

If you choose to retire following today‚Äôs game, we wish you best in the future and most importantly, the best of health.

On behalf of all Blue Jays fan, thank you for being the voice a lot of us grew up listening to when watching the sport we love.

We will miss you.

"Buck Martinez is to a whole generation or two what Tom Cheek was to many fans on the radio side. Such an iconic figure in Toronto sports and he's forgotten more about baseball than any of us knows. Hopefully this wasn't his last game but for the sake of his health and for being with family I will be happy no matter what happens. 

I'll always cherish my memories of Dan &amp; Buck, the silly mispronunciations, seemingly being drunk on air and the sly ""slipping past the censors"" jokes he gets on the air. If Teo's Big Hot Bat was the last of em then that makes me smile :)

"For my job, I literally spend all day evaluating and shaping professional voice performances. Buck is something truly special. I could hear a recording of him saying a single syllable and I would know it was him. His timbre, his delivery, his showmanship mixed with the perfect amount of composure... He is truly one of a kind.  I hope we see him back, but if we don‚Äôt, we should feel blessed that we enjoyed so many years with a man who wasn‚Äôt only a great analyst with a truly insightful baseball mind, but one of the most iconic voices in pro sports broadcasting history.

He's been doing it since I as far back as my memory of baseball allows me, and if he decides to leave it's going to take some adjusting. Listening to other good announcers just isn't the same, Buck and Dan are beyond good, they are the best. I don't want him to stay for me, or the other fans though. As much as I want him to stay, I would love to see him leave on his own accord and him being able to finish off this season was special. If he chooses to leave I'll be happy it was him that got to choose, and not life throwing a wrench in things. I hope if he's retired he pops into the booth on occasion to say hi to Dan on air.",2022-10-08,22:44

"Your broadcasting team is seriously the best.

As a denizen of the high seas until the MLB offers a package for me to actually be able to watch all of the Red Sox games, I sometimes get stuck viewing the other team‚Äôs broadcast. This usually sucks - other teams‚Äô booths don‚Äôt usually know anything about the Red Sox, sound like they hate their jobs, or feature a color guy who‚Äôs not half as funny as he thinks he is.

The Jays broadcast was a breath of fresh air. I have no idea what these dudes‚Äô names are or if they‚Äôre widely liked around here. But the play-by-play guy did an excellent job keeping up with the pace of the ballgame and the production team didn‚Äôt take away from the action with the stupid guest or on-field interviews that you see so much of nowadays. The country-sounding color dude is hilarious. His line about the Jays leaving the equivalent of a small village on base in yesterday‚Äôs game made me spit out my water. The two of them seem to know the Red Sox almost as well as our own broadcasting crew does and called the game almost bias-free which was neat as an away fan.

Even if this may not be y‚Äôall‚Äôs year on the field, I think you might have the best booth in the sport.",2024-06-20,10:07

He was noticeably choked up the other day speaking in memorial about his favorite player of all time, Willie Mays. 

Buck missed half a season a couple years ago while undergoing cancer treatment. When he returned they paused the game for a giant standing ovation from everyone on the field and in the stands, there wasn‚Äôt a dry eye in the house.

Buck has been in the booth for the Jays in one capacity or another since the late 80‚Äôs, shortly after his own 17 year MLB career. He taught me a lot about the game when I was a kid.

The ""country sounding guy"" is Buck Martinez, who has been in the Jays booth for longer than most millennials have been alive.  We are absolutely spoiled with them. They definitely do their homework about the other teams, and they just love baseball. 

On that note, I'm not sure who you guys had in the booth during spring training but the Red Sox broadcast we got for one game was the best away broadcast I heard during spring.  I stopped by your sub to say so and they said it wasn't even the usual guys.",2024-06-20,10:18

Before Dan arrived to do PxP full time Buck was actually the one handling those duties the majority of the time‚Ä¶‚ÄùGet up ball, get out of here‚Äù was his home run tagline if I recall.

"Thanks bud!

I watch a lot of ball games for a lot of teams and was thinking this too but never knew if I was a Homer for my guys! I agree that sooooo many teams hire guys who love the home team, only know the home team or spend an hour talking about themselves. One to avoid iirc is the white sox. They didn't know their players, bashed the opposition, and were rarely on the game. And of course the Yanks love the Yanks and it's the best day ever for them lol.

The only criticism I give is the pre/post show in booth where we go .500 and they talk about how the team is coming together, something started here, and so on and we go on to loose two series at home. I know they are hype guys doing that but it's so rough.",2024-06-20,10:27
Buck is the greatest. I miss when he called the games ‚ÄúSwing and a drive‚Ä¶.‚Äù To me Buck and Tabby were the best combo. Those guys have forgotten more about baseball than we‚Äôll ever know.,2024-06-20,10:42
"Dan is one of the best announcers in the entirety of North American sports, and really should be the conversation with folks like Costas, Vitale, Breen, and Harlan for top echelon ever. Buck is amazing because he's so bulletproof (there'd probably be torches and pitchforks from the fanbase if Rogers even canned him) that he will absolutely shred the team if they need shredding. Joe is a fantastic modern colour commentator. As bad as our team is, holy hell are we spoiled for an announce crew",2024-06-20,10:43

Dan Schulman and Buck Martinez!! Buck is the ‚Äúcountry sounding‚Äù guy you‚Äôre talking about and he is universally beloved. The only baseball card I own is a PSA 10 graded Buck Martinez card for his ‚Äò84 season with the Jays. üòÇ,2024-06-20,14:11
We‚Äôve been terribly spoiled by Dan and Buck.  They are great.,2024-06-20,15:04
"Thank you for the kind words about our broadcasters. I think most Jays fans know how good we have it. Dan is a vet from ESPN with one of the best voices in the biz, and Buck is a former player and manager who has been calling the games for a long time. He's much beloved partly because of his colourful vocal expressions, partly because he once got tagged two guys out at home on the same play despite breaking his leg in the middle of it, and partly because he's got a kind uncle vibe about him that makes us all feel like we're kids watching a game while sitting on the floor in the living room. He's near retirement, so we're getting bonus content this year thanks to him giving few fucks about putting things nicely anymore. It's fun. üòä",2024-06-20,17:44

Tom Cheek and Jerry Howarth, Buck Martinez, Dan Shulman, Gregg Zaun (before he lost his ever-loving mind lol), Joe Siddall, Caleb Joseph, Ben Shulman (Dan's kid), Ben Nicholson-Smith, and I know I'm forgetting some other legends, we have absolutely some of the best to ever do it calling our games, whether on TV or on the radio and it's been this way for the 30+ years I've been listening and watching Jays baseball.

"My man. Stop by anytime. Fun Facts about Buck:

He played baseball back in the old days. He was a catcher for the royals, and brewers, and also the blue jays. He worked with, caught for, and helped mould some of the best pitchers to ever throw a ball.

He wrote an awesome book about baseball. Seriously.

He was manager of the team at one point. 

He's from Florida, but here in Canada, we consider him an honorary Canadian. He's a gosh darn national icon.

He used to do the play by play. His iconic ""get up ball, get up! Aaaand gone!"" is beloved.

He is NOT afraid to call out the team, the management, the ownership, or the players, when things aren't going right, and ownership gives him carte Blanche to basically say whatever he wants (within reason, it's tv).

His love of good baseball will always override any sense of team loyalty, and I feel that's how broadcasters of sports should be.

Between him and Dan,  they basically know everything about baseball. But also, gotta give credit to the team behind the team. The researchers of facts and awesomeness that they seamlessly work into every broadcast. They're heroes too",2024-06-20,19:45
"I was super happy when Dan came back to call Jays games. Kinda met him once, well I cashed him out at Staples about 18 years ago or so. It took a lot of will power to not ask for an autograph. He was just out shopping, didn‚Äôt want to bother him.",2024-06-20,19:49
"  I didn't realize how spoiled we are until I got MLB and started watching games all over the league.  Sometimes there is so much dead air on a broadcast you wonder if they are still there.  Others talk about non baseball related stuff and right over action on the field.  Apple color dude talked about all the players he knew all game long.
  Chicago Cubs ""Marquee"" has two color commentators.  On Father's Day they had a Caray family member do play by play and it reminded me of Dan.
  My wife says there should be a drinking game around when Buck says Tommy Johns.",2024-06-20,21:37
"I never really noticed this I think because living in Western Canada it feels like this is a national broadcast rather than a local one. When I used to watch the Braves on TBS when I was in shock over how cozy they were with their team. As in, ""and Chipper is getting ready on the ondock circle"". And don't get me started on YES network (worse because a division rival).",2024-06-21,00:49
"We truly are blessed. On top of all that, we‚Äôve had broadcasters like Foster Hewitt, and out here in the west, Jim Robson, Jim Hughes, the list goes on.

I agree though, there are worse ones in MLB. We find few other broadcast teams know anything about the Jays, nor Canada!",2024-06-20,10:59

And Dan Schulman‚Äôs voice is pure sex.

When I hear other commentators I can‚Äôt believe how lucky we are.",2024-06-20,14:32

"That's awesome to hear. We're spoiled up here in Canada to get to hear them call every game. I've always wondered if other fan bases enjoy them as much as we do. You honestly learn so much about the game when you hear them talk. Hazel May is great, too. You can tell the whole clubhouse respects the hell out of her.

"What a tremendous season. All-time record for HR by a second baseman. Major league leader in extra base hits. Great mentor for the younger guys, especially Bo.

We all want him to stay, but it just looks so unlikely. He rebuffed all efforts by the team to sign him to an extension. He's looking to go somewhere where he can play shortstop again and he has ties to the Bay Area. We have multiple middle infield prospects in the pipeline.

"Jays need a shortstop .  Bo is an absolute must in  the everyday lineup, because he is a ridiculously dangerous spray hitter with power and average.  But objectively, his range is  average and his arm is below average.  He plays  a bit deep often to compensate for range, which further exposes  his lack of arm. There is no other reason for Vladdy being obliged to take the ball on the hop at first so very often every game. 

Move Bo to second , celebrate Espinal at 3B and buy or trade for a premium SS in the off-season.  Maybe Semien‚Ä¶..",2021-10-04,15:14
"How hard do you really think they tried to sign him to an extension?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll preface this by saying I love Semien and i wish the Jays had an unlimited budget...but they don't. 

Consider:

1. We have Groshans in the pipe (ETA 2022).
2. We have Orelvis Martinez in the pipe (ETA 2023).
3. We have Otto Lopez in the pipe (ETA 2022). 
4. We have a MLB ready stopgap in Biggio.
5.  There is some scuttle that Moreno could convert to 3rd. Bat is major league ready. Jansen and Kirk are good players. 

Given that we have a budget, it really doesn't make much sense to spend what we need to spend on Semien. He's a luxury and we need to save for necessity. IMO - Dollars available need to be saved to lock up our kids and bolster the pitching. Pretty sure the Jays would be thinking along the same lines.",2021-10-05,10:58

Biggio is the future for us at second probably the position he has the most experience playing. Hopefully he can fill semiens position admirably for years to come.,2021-10-03,23:26

"Mr Phillips aka dumb dumb on sportsnet said Semien was more likely to keep then Ray ban if we picked one. As much as I'd like that with the growth of Manoah. That's silly.

Ray has built charities here and may have built some roots.

Semien has openly stated he wants to be a short stop (however he didnt close out returning in media or dodge the question).

Steve Phillips also said we had only 15,000 fans tonight.. you mean 30,000 right. It's always good when analysts pay attention. Dudes checked out",2021-10-04,03:40

"I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôll be hated here‚Ä¶ but I was born and raised in Buffalo, born into a pinstripe family. I grew up with Derek Jeter, his first year in the majors was my first year playing little league softball. They‚Äôve always been my team‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm also a diehard Bisons fan, and I enjoy watching our kids getting called up and doing well, and my fandom for the Blue Jays overall as a team grew this year when they weren‚Äôt able to play at their real home and we were your temporary home. I made it out to 5 Blue Jays games in Buffalo this year and if you watched the games on tv, you may have heard me, I was cheering and screaming louder than anyone there. As this season was ending, I was really hoping for a Yankees/Blue Jays wild card game because I would have been equally excited for whoever would have won. Hate me if you must, but can we all agree to hate the Red Sox together? Lol",2021-10-06,01:11

"Stanton not running, standing watching his hit in the first inning sums up the team. Torres not running to first in a previous game, dropped foul but he would have made it. That's coaching's fault, I'd say. Remember when Springer (Jays) hit that for sure catch fly ball that the outfielder dropped? George was standing on 2nd when the camera came back to him. Jays are grinders, Yankees aren't.",2021-10-06,08:37
