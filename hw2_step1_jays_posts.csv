I know my old hand mixer is due to be replaced soon (which was only $30 and has lasted about 3 years), but someone who does a high amount of cooking and moderate amount of baking, I can certainly see the appeal in one, but is it really good long term for the kitchen?  ",2016-04-26,['360426114']

Let's upvote the shit out of this so /r/baseball will get really confused when they do the weekly state of the subreddit post,2016-04-26,['360426114']
"Is...this post in the right place?  Have I missed something??

You know what...fuck it.

YES, they are awesome mixers but like you said, IF you do a good amount of baking, and have attachments for cooking.  THAT said, you can very often find them on sale at a pretty decent deal, say around $200 - $300 or less depending on the model (like if you don't go for one of the professional series ones.)  So if you wait for a good sale (say, Black Friday or boxing week), and do a moderate amount of baking, it's pretty worth it.  In fact, for the long haul, if you do only a light amount of baking, it is also worth it.  Because then you have it, and when you want to make pancakes, cakes, cupcakes or cookies or *whatever*, you have it, you whip it out, it does a fantastic job for you, then goes back into storage, waiting to be used again.

Future Shop used to have a sale on the mixers plus their attachments every year (attachments were like 50% off), that coincided with an annual rebate period KitchenAid would have for the mixers and attachments.  So you could get one of the mixers on sale and a few attachments, and get another $50 or so back in rebates.  RIP Future Shop.  I'm not sure if Best Buy has continued the tradition or not.

Or look for clearance sales at places like Costco.ca, and you may find one being discontinued massively discounted.  I got a pretty decent one, middle of the road in their model lineup, on clearance for over 50% off, so it was under $200, a few years ago.  It's rock solid, but, it also only gets light usage.

Back before the 2000's (not sure about 2000's themselves) all models used to be made with metal gears.  Now they are made with a heavy plastic (not sure about the pro series).  This was a point of issue for people who had their mixers for like 30 - 40 years, and were disappointed when replacing them.  However, if you are not a heavy duty baker, then this probably won't be an issue for you ever. 

ATTACHMENTS

I have the ice cream maker and pasta roller attachments.  Both are pretty wicked.  Back when I used to have more time, I loved making home made pasta.  Fresh home made pasta is damned delicious.  And the texture is so nice.  Puts packaged pasta to shame.  I envy people who have their nonna living with them.  

Home made ice cream is also amazing.  Right when you finish making it, you basically have soft serve ice cream and it's so damn good (the more cream the merrier).  Then you put it in the freezer, and it's more like regular ice cream again...but if you take it out and let it sit for 5 minutes, it's back to being like soft serve again.  Mmmmm....  Also being able to make your own flavours is very cool.  Made pumpkin ice cream around thanksgiving a few times...wow.


Also, if this was a shitpost...then....damn you.

If it wasn't, then, I hope this helped!

"I think you need to do a rough calculations of how many hours per week you spend mixing. From there - extrapolate how much time you spend mixing in a given year. Once you know how many hours you will likely spend mixing then you can calculate - based on the warranty of the machine - your exact dollar per hour spent mixing. 

With that data in hand your could potentially cross-reference against other competing off-brand mixers, and judge whether you would indeed get value from that type of item as opposed to a Kitchenaid. 

If you're working in the kitchen for seven months a year and baking moderately then you may not need to spend as much money on a high end item. If you're going to be baking at a high level for 9 months of the year then maybe it's worth investing in your kitchen items.

"Kitchenaid Stand Mixers are pricey, but I think they're worth it.  

With your old hand mixer on it's way out, and no replacement in sight, now is the time to make a splash on the free agent market and add a top-end mixer to your baking line up.   Some people may agree with Paul Beeston and prefer not to hand out long term deals, but I like the idea of locking down a mixer like the Kitchenaid Stand Mixer for 10+ years, even if it does cost $500.  

I'm not a numbers expert, but I'd expect you to be able to get 8-10 DAR (Desserts Above Replacement) for at least your first 5 years with the mixer.  Numbers may start to decline slowly after that, but the mixer should preform well even into the late stages of it's career.  

I know these mixers come in a variety of colours, but I'd suggest something neutral.  If you're faced with a complete kitchen rebuild in the coming years, you'd want the Kitchenaid mixer to fit in with it's new surroundings.  The trade market will be limited for a big ticket item like this.

With zero knowledge of how they work I pulled it apart, found the broken bit, ordered a new bit off of Kitchenaid for the low, low price of $30, put it back together, and it's as good as new. That's exactly what you want in a product, simple and reliable so they'll run for ages without issue, but then easy to fix and get parts for if something does go wrong. And they still build them exactly the same way, so I can feel confident that if something else breaks in another 10 years, I'll be able to get the part and fix it.

Literally nothing these days is built like that, it's brilliant. I realise this is a crazy rant to go on in a joke topic about a mixer, but I love that fucking mixer.",2016-04-26,['360426114']
"My wife has had hers for about 10 years, and swears by it. I've also had pretty good luck with cheaper paddle attachments on Amazon.

"My wife and are married 10 years next month, and got one as a wedding present.  Of all the gifts we got that day, only the Kitchenaid and some plain white Cuisinart plates/bowls have survived the decade-long test of time.  (and our marriage, I suppose)

It gets used multiple times per week, sometimes very heavy use on weekends when we're cooking up a storm of things to freeze for weekday dinners. 

We have the pasta attachment, used a few dozen times, a vegetable strainer that i've never seen get used, and a meat grinder that I got recently and kind of love using.  (Buy a big cheap beef shoulder roast, cut into cubes, freeze for a few minutes, and grind it up with some salt+pepper and a bit of chopped up raw bacon, best burgers you'll ever eat.)

It's sat in a prime counter location since we got it, the attachments sit on shelves in their original boxes, pulled out as needed.  

Literally every other appliance in our kitchen has been replaced since we got it.  Fridge, stove, toaster, waffle iron, the effing phone, the old crock pot, friggen everything died, but the Kitchenaid keeps on truckin.  ",2016-04-27,['360427114']

I'm not usually superstitious but while watching Game 1, I just couldn't shake the feeling that I *knew* the Jays would win if I just stopped watching. They were down 7-2, I had some stuff to do so I turned off the TV and went to my PC. Within moments I saw the Jays were now at 5 runs so I just left it be. A few times I'd see the Jays get people on base so I caved a few times and flipped the game on and I'd immediately see the rally killed. I decided to just stay away. The Jays eventually came back to win 11-10.

For Game 2, I had the opposite feeling. I felt like I *needed* to watch for them to win. I went back to the living room, laid down and got comfortable. Suddenly, the fire alarm goes off in my building. Normally I ignore it because we usually get a lot of false alarms but within moments we could hear people shouting from downstairs outside that there's a fire and people need to get out.

Me and my wife run downstairs and pretty much just wait around with the other tenants while the fire trucks come in and battle the fire. When the firemen finally start wrapping up their equipment and the stress is down, I pop open my at-bat app to see the Jays are being no hit. So I say screw it, top of the order coming up. I turn on MLB.TV and about 30 seconds later, Vladdy breaks up the no-hitter. I've been watching since.

*Posted this in r/baseball too but it was meant for this thread, lol.*",2021-09-11,['401229188']

"Jays need a shortstop .  Bo is an absolute must in  the everyday lineup, because he is a ridiculously dangerous spray hitter with power and average.  But objectively, his range is  average and his arm is below average.  He plays  a bit deep often to compensate for range, which further exposes  his lack of arm. There is no other reason for Vladdy being obliged to take the ball on the hop at first so very often every game. 

Move Bo to second , celebrate Espinal at 3B and buy or trade for a premium SS in the off-season.  Maybe Semien‚Ä¶..",2021-10-04,[]
"How hard do you really think they tried to sign him to an extension?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll preface this by saying I love Semien and i wish the Jays had an unlimited budget...but they don't. 

Consider:

1. We have Groshans in the pipe (ETA 2022).
2. We have Orelvis Martinez in the pipe (ETA 2023).
3. We have Otto Lopez in the pipe (ETA 2022). 
4. We have a MLB ready stopgap in Biggio.
5.  There is some scuttle that Moreno could convert to 3rd. Bat is major league ready. Jansen and Kirk are good players. 

Given that we have a budget, it really doesn't make much sense to spend what we need to spend on Semien. He's a luxury and we need to save for necessity. IMO - Dollars available need to be saved to lock up our kids and bolster the pitching. Pretty sure the Jays would be thinking along the same lines.",2021-10-05,[]

"I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôll be hated here‚Ä¶ but I was born and raised in Buffalo, born into a pinstripe family. I grew up with Derek Jeter, his first year in the majors was my first year playing little league softball. They‚Äôve always been my team‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm also a diehard Bisons fan, and I enjoy watching our kids getting called up and doing well, and my fandom for the Blue Jays overall as a team grew this year when they weren‚Äôt able to play at their real home and we were your temporary home. I made it out to 5 Blue Jays games in Buffalo this year and if you watched the games on tv, you may have heard me, I was cheering and screaming louder than anyone there. As this season was ending, I was really hoping for a Yankees/Blue Jays wild card game because I would have been equally excited for whoever would have won. Hate me if you must, but can we all agree to hate the Red Sox together? Lol",2021-10-06,[]

"Stanton not running, standing watching his hit in the first inning sums up the team. Torres not running to first in a previous game, dropped foul but he would have made it. That's coaching's fault, I'd say. Remember when Springer (Jays) hit that for sure catch fly ball that the outfielder dropped? George was standing on 2nd when the camera came back to him. Jays are grinders, Yankees aren't.",2021-10-06,[]
