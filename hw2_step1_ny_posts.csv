"Diptyque master race reporting in. 

But for a more reasonable, local option, I recommend the Fir Needles candle from Bedrock Tree Farms. Actually a great story: family-owned fir tree company was in dire straits and needed a new revenue stream, so they started melting down pine needles to make candles. Those of you who enjoy Balsam &amp; Cedar will like this one. They also have a wooden wick, which makes nice little crackling noises. Perfect for the winter, but we're all indoors all the time anyway now. 

We are truly living in a Golden Age of scented candles. Wherever you go, every little boutique is stocked with multiple brands of small batch, independently crafted candles. Most are locally owned/made, so they make great little mementos when you travel. Highly recommend giving this a shot if you haven't, especially if you live in NYC: there is no better way to create a spa-like atmosphere in our crappy little apartments.",2020-09-06,['401226278']

"Seems like nothing but trolling, inside jokes, needless upvote parties and overall nonsense on this sub these days (and even much of last season). I get that the inner circle who apparently have a TON of time to spend on here thinks it's funny, but a lot of us came over from r/yankees because that sub became such a joke, and we wanted something more substantive and active. This was a better alternative, but I'm not so sure that's the case now because this high school style clique has formed and all they do is spew nothing but inside jokes that few people even understand.
  
Do we have to start a new Yankees sub that's not childish as fuck or completely inactive? Or will the mods start doing their job and make this a community for all 7k+ members and not just one for the handful of idiots that think this is their high school lunch table?
  
Sad to see that lesser teams' subs (r/Reds) are getting actual players to do AMAs, and this sub is filled with a bunch of people who, over a full 24 hour span, think it's hilarious that someone accidentally posted a news article more than once, so they respond by posting the same fucking thing over and over in every language possible. It's not funny, it's just annoying.

"I met Aaron Judge at a restaurant once - we’d accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says “I’m so sorry, but we’d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we’ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you’d like while you’re in town.” My sister and cousin were both like “Yeah that’s cool.” and I kind of played the asshole a bit. “I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. We’ve been here for 15 minutes - we’ve just ordered. Can’t we finish our meal here?” Then out of nowhere Aaron Judge shows up next to the manager and says “Paul, these guys can finish. We’ll be at the bar. I got some time.” And I (being a big fan of massive dongers) said “Oh wow, uh… I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.” Aaron was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Aaron Judge and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents.",2017-10-17,"['371016110', '371017110']"

"Evidence has been mounting up over the last few years and this season has blown the lid off this conspiracy.

It started with Aaron Judge. An obvious create-a-player. Max height, max weight, #99, badass name, and obviously maxed out stats all the way around. I’m pretty sure I created the exact character in MVP Baseball 2005.

FA comes around and this kid missed out on Harper AND Machado. So what does this kid do? He throws a temper tantrum and edits two random 55 overall scrubs to straight 99’s — Gio Urshela and Mike Tauchman. Who needs Harper and Machado now?

The season starts and the kid starts simulating and two games in he has to cancel simulation because he lost TO THE FUCKING ORIOLES. Can’t let that happen again. NOPE. He’s played every game against the orioles since, manually, with difficulty set to beginner. FUCK the orioles, this kid says, as he smacks dinger after dinger against them.

TL;DR— we’re living in a simulation and the Yankees are proof.

Edit— MVP Baseball. Also love this community so much the 10 year old in the sky is gonna bring us to the promise land!",2019-08-14,['401076533']

The Red Sox need a new direction and fast in order to salvage a winning team and revamp this team as soon as next year.

So they need a GM with a more Cherington mindset now. Someone that's really good at getting prospects and building up a farm system. So that's the new direction we need to go in. Dombrowski isn't that so he's pointless to have at the top. 

This is the end of a never-ending cycle due to horrendous ownership. There's no consistency. We have Cherington bring us an elite farm and then we dump him to get Dombrowski to turn that farm into MLB star players (which he went overkill on) and now we need to dump him to get a GM to build up the farm, who will then in a couple years be fired for another GM that will trade the farm.",2019-09-10,['401076896']

However, Gumby stepped up in a big way and pitched an excellent 4 innings before giving way to the bullpen. Only Cole has given us a better start this postseason, as Tanaka and Happ struggled.

The game is still being played but if the Yankees do win, Jordan Montgomery deserves a ton of credit.",2020-10-08,['401246364']

Credit to Higgy for calling a good game behind Gumby as well,2020-10-08,['401246364']
I don’t usually feel proud of our players because they’re grown ass millionaires but idk why I definitely felt proud of Gumby tonight. He could’ve sucked tonight and honestly no one would’ve blamed him. The fact that he bent twice but refused to break was for some reason extremely touching. Maybe I’m getting old.,2020-10-08,['401246364']
Battled today and did what was needed of him.,2020-10-08,['401246364']
The idea of Gumby starting today scared the crap out of me. He has been very inconsistent and the fear that bad Gumby would show up made me super nervous. But he did darn well and we managed to force game 5. The team may be able to overcome mismanagement again.,2020-10-08,['401246364']

"I would give this an award if I had one. It cannot be stated enough how huge it was for Monty to step up like he did. It reminded me of Pettite.

"I loved every second of it. After being considered a maybe as a number 5 starter, proving himself but still being doubted, having to get Tommy John....it was simply wonderful to see him pitch so well tonight.

I think Happ shoulda started that game TBH like he has his whole career,2020-10-09,['401246368']
"To me, he wasn’t getting enough credit at all. He was my hero for the game and saving the season for another day. I get it, 4 innings isn’t long, and he gave up the game’s only run, but the game always hinged on his performance. We knew we had Green, Britton, and Chapman all ready and they could give us at least 4 innings if not 5. If Montgomery goes out there and throws a stinker, gives up 5 in 3 innings, we are screwed. He did exactly what we needed him to do. Sure it would have been awesome if he gave us 5, but he was the biggest reason we won the game (IMO) and was the biggest reason I was so nervous headed into the game.",2020-10-09,['401246368']
"One thing I found really interesting is during the regular season we saw two Gumbys: lockdown, lights out Gumby, and bad Gumby. Last night there were still people on base but he stayed under control and got those huge outs. Incredible performance",2020-10-09,['401246368']
I'm a fan of Gumby since he appeared in the big league roster. Real Andy Pettite vibes.,2020-10-09,['401246368']

"I was skeptical, I was worried, and I was even a little angry. I said, ""what has Montgomery ever done to make me feel good about him starting this game?""

"&gt;The crowd was angry that day my friends,

&gt;Like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli.

&gt;I got near the pitchers mound and suddenly, the struggling Betances appeared before me. 

&gt;I tell ya he was 6'6 if he was afoot.

&gt;In sensing my presence, he let out a great bellow. 

&gt;I said, ""EASY THERE, DELLIN""

&gt;And then, as i watched him throw warmup tosses, I noticed something was obstructing his breathing.

&gt;Where i was standing, i was able to see STRAIGHT into the eye of the great starter (reliever, whatever).

&gt;All the sudden, something led me to the mound and i was right face to face with his mouth. 

&gt;I can barely see from beer cans being tossed down on top of me, but i knew something was there. 

&gt;So i reached my hand in, felt around and PULLED out the obstruction.

**George is holding a half-eaten calzone from Pizzano's that Dellin stole from Steinbrenners office.**

"Gary Sanchez has had one of the most up and down careers of any athlete in the last thirty years. When he is at his best he is shattering records, at his worst he can single-handedly lose you a series. Many of us thought that it was a lack of consistency, or maybe even a lack of effort after he experiences a deep run of success and he grows complacent; but is there something more here? Something deeper? Is his desire to avoid playing like ass simply a side effect of an even stronger desire for Booty?

Gary Sanchez made his MLB debut in 2015, going 0-2 in his first career game. He was given an opportunity to win the backup catcher role in 2016, that he lost to future brawling ally vs Miguel Cabrera Austin Romine. Gary was promoted for good finally on August 3rd, 2016.

In August of 2016, there were rumors flying that Jennifer Lopez, noted Yankees' fan and thickness ambassador, was on the outs in her relationship of 2 years with then-current boyfriend Casper Smart. On August 16th a report came out that they had split up, and Casper was seen out and about in Hollywood with Nicole Schezerzneeergniner of the Pussycat Dolls. Later that night Gary Sanchez posted the first two homer night of his career. He would go on to win AL Player of the Week, hitting .523 and winning Player of the Week the following week and Player of the Month. That season Gary became the first player in MLB history with at least 11 home runs and 31 hits in his first 23 career games, and became the fastest player in history to hit 19 home runs. Despite playing in less than 60 games, Gary nearly won the AL Rookie of the Year award. Was a desire to impress the now available Lopez what drove his Herculean effort to keep the 2016 Yankees relevant? 

Fast forward to 2017 and Gary is coming into the season with the weight of New York on his shoulders. He struggled mightily to start the year, and despite a strong enough rally to get himself a spot in the Allstar Game and Home Run Derby, he was fading hard by July and early August. Was it the expectations that wore him down? Or was it that Jlo had since found love in a former Yankee star in February, causing him to spiral?

Ironically, Gary's struggles only abated after he attended a dinner with mentor Alex Rodriguez, and, you guessed it, his current girlfriend Jennifer Lopez. Immediately following the dinner Gary hit .471 with three home runs the following 5 games, crediting Ms. Lopez with giving him ""Positive advice and a positive experience."" He also spoke of her as a great actress, a compliment as wide reaching and generous as an Angel Hernandez strike zone for one of the 11 pitchers left in baseball he doesn't hold contempt for. Gary would go on to win the 2017 Silver Slugger for Catcher.

As injuries reached him, as well as time away from Jennifer while she strengthened her bond with Arod, Gary suffered a terrible 2018. Gary had a bounce back 2019, hitting 34 home runs and benefiting from a much healthier season and a trimmer body, though some experts, (I guess just me, so *all* experts), speculate that his renewed power came from renewed hope after an April bombshell by Jose Conseco revealed potential cheating rumors that threatened the union of the abbreviation power couple of Arod and Jlo.

In 2020 Arod and Jlo doubled down on their wedding, saying it was coming, just delayed due to the pandemic. This possibly triggered one of the worst seasons in Yankees' baseball history, including a .147 average and -0.3 War in just 49 games.

Gary came into camp of 2021 in good shape again, and did have a good first two games before slumping again. Hope arrived, however, in the second half of April in the form of the announcement of Arod and Jen's separation. Gary finished his April batting .190, then batted .213 with four homers in May, followed by a June where his is currently batting over .300 for the month with six home runs and 13 RBI's, with a week still remaining.

Further studies will need to be conducted with the return of Dare Devil and noted Red Sox lover Ben Afflec into her life, but as a Yankees' fan Jeniffer Lopez needs to truly ask herself; is a fling with an ex really worth throwing away one of the greatest hitting catchers of all time? Would her time not be better spent in the arms of a younger man who could give her not only the wedding ring that has alluded her for so long, but a World Series ring powered by love?
