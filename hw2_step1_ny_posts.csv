"There's a poll over at r/Baseball and a lot petitions at other sports subs to ban X links, a lot of which has to do with difficulty accessing them such as account required, as well as some of the less savory behavior by Musk (Nazi salutes anyone?). What do you think?  ",2025-01-21,12:28
So the post banning X is bigger than the Yankees going to the WS?,2025-01-23,21:27
This thread is hilarious!!!!,2025-01-22,11:51
Yogi Berra and Joe DiMaggio served in the war against Nazi’s. Let’s ban that trash.,2025-01-21,12:41
"I think it's very sad that this is the top post of all time on this subreddit by a massive margin. The team won the American League last season and went to the World Series, but that post doesn't even have half the upvotes that this 2 day old post that has nothing to do with the Yankees. I try very hard to stay away from politics but this is kind of ridiculous.

I find it highly unlikely that this post organically got that this many upvotes, but honestly I don't know what can/should be done about it.

Also I'd like to add that I've personally been against Twitter ever since they required an account to browse it. I just think it's a shame that this post is more upvoted than moments that we all loved.",2025-01-23,16:30

"Fully on board.

Not being able to see the links unless you are signed in should've been enough of a reason to ditch it. The fact that it's ultra politicized now should make it an obvious decision.

But if people opposed to Trump and Elon are going to see Nazism everywhere they look like religious zealots seeing the Virgin Mary in cappuccino foam, it's going to be a long four years for this country. Screaming about dubious connections to Nazism has become annoying white noise. No one takes it seriously anymore who isn't already bought in. Let it go.

"Hi. Jew here and an avid Yankees fan as well as someone who very much loathes Trump and his shortbus clown car full of degenerates. Couple things:

1. Musk is not a Nazi nor is he even vaguely antisemitic. Dude was obviously on moly or shrooms (read about how he’s been using designer drugs) and was sperging out saying his heart is full and giving it to the crowd.  

2. Where the hell were all y’all “anti-nazi” people when terrorist sympathizers and Arab-Islamist supremacists were beating up and intimidating Jews on college campuses and on the streets of our cities while calling for an intifada/advocating genocide ?

"It’s where sports news breaks almost exclusively. If you feel so strongly about, don’t click the link. I think that banning the sharing of those links completely would slow down the activity of the sub drastically. Just my two cents.",2025-01-21,12:35
"Since those of us without twittex accounts can only see the original post and not follow the story on that site anyway, would a screenshot of the post suffice? On Reddit we usually see something like: (PASSAN) on X ""Yankees kicking the tires on a Pete Alonso deal."" 
Then, after clicking the link we get a headshot of Passan and the same ""Yankees kicking the tires on a Pete Alonso deal."" quote, while also navigating a popup window telling us ""There's more on X. Join to follow this conversation."" 
So if we choose NOT to ban, (though I am in favor) could screenshots of the X post be a middle ground? Is there an ethical part of this that we should be concerned with? 
IDKY I care, bc truly the ""hand gesture that may have in some way, but in no way is, reminiscent of a somewhat Nazi-ish, possibly salute"" was the last straw for me.",2025-01-21,13:01

"No, it was not a ""Nazi salute"":

From [Time magazine](https://time.com/7208614/elon-musk-nazi-salute-reactions-debate-controversy-adl-trump-inauguration/): The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization whose mission is to combat antisemitism and which describes a “Hitler salute” as one with an “outstretched right arm with the palm down,” posted on X shortly after the incident that the billionaire Trump mega-donor “made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute,” and that “all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath.”

And, no, links to X should not be banned. This is not a political sub.

Edit: I read a lot of political writers on X and elsewhere. I come to the sports subs to get AWAY from politics. Please keep it out of this one.",2025-01-21,13:42

I want to say thank you to the members and staff for providing a safe, lively home base to discuss Yankee baseball. (Yes, even the doomers). I’m grateful that hundreds of fellow fans are here everyday, as opposed to the wasteland that is r/Redsox. I’ve only been here 1 season, but I can feel the presence of deep-rooted connections in every thread. Most of you have sat through the highest of highs and lowest of lows here, with the latter being the common theme for the last 7 years. I’m talking about destiny being ripped away by cheaters, questionable and at some times infuriating game management, uninspired offense, blah. But now, all that trauma is history. We can put that all in the past. We, and our glorious Log Cabin are going to the final dance. It’s not in front of us or behind us, it’s happening right fucking now, and it’s what we fucking want.

"Diptyque master race reporting in. 

But for a more reasonable, local option, I recommend the Fir Needles candle from Bedrock Tree Farms. Actually a great story: family-owned fir tree company was in dire straits and needed a new revenue stream, so they started melting down pine needles to make candles. Those of you who enjoy Balsam &amp; Cedar will like this one. They also have a wooden wick, which makes nice little crackling noises. Perfect for the winter, but we're all indoors all the time anyway now. 

We are truly living in a Golden Age of scented candles. Wherever you go, every little boutique is stocked with multiple brands of small batch, independently crafted candles. Most are locally owned/made, so they make great little mementos when you travel. Highly recommend giving this a shot if you haven't, especially if you live in NYC: there is no better way to create a spa-like atmosphere in our crappy little apartments.",2020-09-06,09:27

* Judge's strike zone is something the Yankees will HAVE to ask MLB to address. Umpires need to review some footage and adjust next season. Judge's zone is a joke.

"Seems like nothing but trolling, inside jokes, needless upvote parties and overall nonsense on this sub these days (and even much of last season). I get that the inner circle who apparently have a TON of time to spend on here thinks it's funny, but a lot of us came over from r/yankees because that sub became such a joke, and we wanted something more substantive and active. This was a better alternative, but I'm not so sure that's the case now because this high school style clique has formed and all they do is spew nothing but inside jokes that few people even understand.
  
Do we have to start a new Yankees sub that's not childish as fuck or completely inactive? Or will the mods start doing their job and make this a community for all 7k+ members and not just one for the handful of idiots that think this is their high school lunch table?
  
Sad to see that lesser teams' subs (r/Reds) are getting actual players to do AMAs, and this sub is filled with a bunch of people who, over a full 24 hour span, think it's hilarious that someone accidentally posted a news article more than once, so they respond by posting the same fucking thing over and over in every language possible. It's not funny, it's just annoying.
  
I'm sure the regulars guilty of what I'm talking about will shit on this post (I can't wait for every comment to be the immature but wholly predictable ""So what happened with Jacob Lindgren har har""), but lurkers and lesser involved members: Do I have a point here?

"I met Aaron Judge at a restaurant once - we’d accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says “I’m so sorry, but we’d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we’ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you’d like while you’re in town.” My sister and cousin were both like “Yeah that’s cool.” and I kind of played the asshole a bit. “I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. We’ve been here for 15 minutes - we’ve just ordered. Can’t we finish our meal here?” Then out of nowhere Aaron Judge shows up next to the manager and says “Paul, these guys can finish. We’ll be at the bar. I got some time.” And I (being a big fan of massive dongers) said “Oh wow, uh… I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.” Aaron was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Aaron Judge and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents.",2017-10-17,20:49

Sorry this is a guilty pleasure of mine

&gt;I have never felt such seething rage towards anything in life than what I feel for the fucking New York Yankees. They represent everything fucking wrong about baseball. Their fans are fucking degenerates who take credit for successes that happened decades before they were even born. The entire organization is a bunch of fucking bullies that just buy success.

&gt;Fuck the Yankees. I'm taking off my Twins hat and putting on my Astros hat and hope they just embarrass them.

"Chapman did his job to the best of his ability.  It's a FO failure to think a guy can throw 104 for that long.  
  
The biggest dumb is that we had DRob on the roster and they let him walk for Chapman.  Relievers I think were better closers than Chapman during his tenure: 
  
Adam Warren(Maybe not but that's my guy)  
Chad Green  
Dellin Betances  
Zack Britton  
Tommy Tightpants  
Clay Holmes  
  
It wasn't a bad idea to try to lock down another shut out closer type but Chapman never was that.  We would have been better served with a revolving door because for every batter we strike out on, we hit on a reliever who at least has a 3-4 year window minimum.  
  
That's not to say Chapman wasn't good - he was.  He just wasn't as good as we expected when we got our first big name post Mo, and nobody's ever going to beat Mo.  I'm 100% certain of that - you just can't find another one of those.",2023-01-20,02:41

There was nothing on a personal level to root for the guy on... he came in on the lowest note you can come in on, and he goes out on a low note too, and did little to make up for it in the middle.

In terms of his stuff... no idea why a team with a tight budget like KC would waste almost four million on the guy. He made a career of being the hardest thrower of all time... and now he struggles to hit 100mph in a time where that's not at all uncommon.

"AL east champions for the first time in too long, lets fucking go! Finish out the season strong for HFA, then its just 11 wins until immortality

Its unfortunate, but I think we really need a 'state of the sub' from the mods. If i had to guess our record from how this sub talks id have guess we would be currently battling for the last WC spot not AL east champions. I know the WS drought and lack of post season success is getting to everyone but for fucks sake, even if we win it all, I couldn't keep enough receipts of the countless ""fire boone/cashman"" posts, the endless ""we have no hitters after the two best hitters in the league"" posts, the unending 'this team cant win anything in October' comments after every loss. And yet here were are, best in the east, gunning for HFA, and looking for #28

  
I dont know if its the fact ive grown up a dolphins fan, but some of you need to stand up and smell the daisies. We are an unarguable top 3 team in the MLB, primed for a deep post season run, coming off a season made for a world series dvd from YES. The next month will be one that you will tell your grandkids about, we won't need no game 6 or 7, we are a month away from celebrating another ring dressed as deadpool/beatlejuice/jojo siwa",2024-09-26,22:34

"Evidence has been mounting up over the last few years and this season has blown the lid off this conspiracy.

It started with Aaron Judge. An obvious create-a-player. Max height, max weight, #99, badass name, and obviously maxed out stats all the way around. I’m pretty sure I created the exact character in MVP Baseball 2005.

FA comes around and this kid missed out on Harper AND Machado. So what does this kid do? He throws a temper tantrum and edits two random 55 overall scrubs to straight 99’s — Gio Urshela and Mike Tauchman. Who needs Harper and Machado now?

The season starts and the kid starts simulating and two games in he has to cancel simulation because he lost TO THE FUCKING ORIOLES. Can’t let that happen again. NOPE. He’s played every game against the orioles since, manually, with difficulty set to beginner. FUCK the orioles, this kid says, as he smacks dinger after dinger against them.

TL;DR— we’re living in a simulation and the Yankees are proof.

Edit— MVP Baseball. Also love this community so much the 10 year old in the sky is gonna bring us to the promise land!",2019-08-14,11:21

"Dombrowski's job is done. We have a trash farm system and we are loaded on a lot of horrendous contracts. Dombrowski isn't known to build up farm systems and he no longer has major trade assets (other than Mookie Betts) that are likely to be worth anything. The Red Sox need a new direction and fast in order to salvage a winning team and revamp this team as soon as next year.

So they need a GM with a more Cherington mindset now. Someone that's really good at getting prospects and building up a farm system. So that's the new direction we need to go in. Dombrowski isn't that so he's pointless to have at the top. 

This is the end of a never-ending cycle due to horrendous ownership. There's no consistency. We have Cherington bring us an elite farm and then we dump him to get Dombrowski to turn that farm into MLB star players (which he went overkill on) and now we need to dump him to get a GM to build up the farm, who will then in a couple years be fired for another GM that will trade the farm.",2019-09-10,01:00

On last night’s broadcast. Brilliant quote because it’s spot on. Stanton always deals with it. Fans know it too. Those boobirds last night were out there to summon angry playoff Stanton.,2022-09-21,08:52
"I love Giancarlo Stanton, despite his faults, this guy is proud to be a Yankee",2022-09-21,09:31
"Plus, it's probably worth mentioning that Stanton clearly came back at less than full strength because the team needed him, and a Dongcarlo who can't run or play the field is still better than any version of Aaron Hicks.",2022-09-21,09:44
"Not only is coney the voice of reason to some of the more ignorant Yankee faithful, but he’s just unmatched energy and insight. Who better than him to describe the beast that is Yankee stadium and stand up for a guy who conquers it in such a way like Giancarlo Stanton.

Remember that Stanton always said he’d go to NY to win before he was traded here. He may be silent about it but he’s carrying his story and a lost friend with him.",2022-09-21,10:00
Stanton never cries about the fans to the media or makes excuses. He doesnt boo the fans like that idiot Lindor. He just fucking goes out there and does his job,2022-09-21,09:36

"He’s never mentioned the fans negatively. not even once. Even when he first started out here (by being traded, mind you) and was BRUTAL to watch he kept his head down and said he needed to do better and then he did. I remember seeing Baez doing the whole thumbs down thing at mets fans and it gave me a whole new appreciation for Stanton. I dont think i could ever find it in myself to boo him. Dude is all class",2022-09-21,10:22
"It’s amazing to me how , between consecutive ABs , Stanton can go from looking like he’s never played baseball in his life to as if he’s seeing beach balls at the plate",2022-09-21,10:25

It’s true. Stanton has never complained once. Hicks and gallo should’ve looked up to guys like him and judge.,2022-09-21,09:36
"I love rooting for Stanton, all the guy does it try. Even when he’s obviously hurt, he’s grinding. This might be one of his worst years overall, and he’s still likely to end up with 30 bombs, most of which tied the game or gave the Yankees the lead.",2022-09-21,10:22
"Stanton is the best proof on why the likes of Gallo and Monty can act upset all they want about the NY treatment and they can kindly F off. Stanton was booed in his very first game. He was torched after his awful first playoff showing. But he never lost himself to controversy, never showed emotion to it. The guy just understands, because he expects greatness from himself. You don't become a chiseled Greek god with anything less. Playoff Stanton ready to carry once again.",2022-09-21,09:39
Unsure if I’ve seen a ball players eyes more intimidating than right before he barreled up last night.,2022-09-21,11:48
"Why the fuck are people still booing Stanton?

He could go hitless for a month and I would still cheer for the guy purely for those two bombs he hit against Boston last season.",2022-09-21,12:02
Idk how fans can boo the guy when year after year he is the only one that shows up in the playoffs,2022-09-21,12:19

To paraphrase Jeter who said it best: Yankee fans boo because they want to cheer.,2022-09-21,12:09
"Was really glad to hear this from Cone because I couldn’t agree more. I remember being at games in 2018 mystified by the way fans were treating a player who was carrying us after Judge got hurt. He’s one of the streakiest players in baseball, he’s a tough watch at times, fair is fair, but Giancarlo Stanton is a consummate pro and a guy I’d go to war with on this team 10 times out of 10. He embraces everything being a Yankee is about to Yankees fans. Like Cone said, he gets it.",2022-09-21,12:19
He’s my favorite Yankee.,2022-09-21,10:21
"Stanton's mental strength is fucking incredible.

whether it's how he's come back and returned after having his face rearranged a few years ago, or how he adjusted to new york after the early boos, or turning into a monster in the postseason or against our biggest rivals. the guy's mental toughness is unbelievable and this fanbase needs to be a lot better to him.",2022-09-21,11:36
"Love how he’s an honest guy about the mental side of baseball. Coming from a guy with his stature, it’s cool to see.",2022-09-21,10:20
He’s the real deal.,2022-09-21,10:08
G is very hot and cold and has been a lightning rod at times.  A lightning rod that’s kept the team grounded to the point where fans may get frustrated at times but he’s won over the fan base and I don’t think a lot of fans are going to have anything negative to say about him.,2022-09-21,13:29
"Stanton has proven himself and plays hard, no excuses. I would never boo him even if he’s 0 for 30",2022-09-21,10:45
"He's clearly been playing at less than 100% in the second half because the Yankees were getting desperate, and his numbers have suffered accordingly.  Guy never complains about it, just goes out there and does his job.  I wish he'd been more of the guy he was with the Marlins, but I have nothing but respect for Big G.",2022-09-21,11:55
[deleted],2022-09-21,12:11
I don't understand how any Yankee fan can talk bad about this guy. He has absolutely shown up when it counts and has acted as professionally as it gets. Even when he slumps you can't be mad at him since he's given this team so much in the short time that he's been here. I was at the game last night and I felt so bad when people were booing.,2022-09-21,12:54
This is about Stanton but I really wanna say hearing Cone last night was a delight. He’s my fav I think. I wish he was on every broadcast,2022-09-21,11:05
"Personally, I can't stand it when fans boo the players.  I find it a little embarrassing.",2022-09-21,13:32
I’m not sure what booing really accomplishes.  I’m sure that he’s doing his best.  Some of the fanbase can be so fickle.,2022-09-21,10:15
People should stop booing Stanton tbh,2022-09-21,10:45
Why are we booing him is the real question,2022-09-21,11:16

"David Cone is pretty much my favorite guy in the booth of all time. Not from the standpoint of being 'the voice' a la Rizzuto, Kay, or Ma and Pa. But in terms of insight, takes, enthusiasm, smarts, blend of old and new-think, etc.",2022-09-21,14:15
We go as Stanton goes . Judge is gonna be the mvp but I’ve been telling my friends this for a while. Stanton puts more fear into the opposing pitchers than judge does.,2022-09-21,16:31
Stanton is a man. He accepted the Bronx and they accept him. I think the fans want so badly to cheer for him as best they can.,2022-09-21,19:09
Loved when Cone said that. Say what you want about Giancarlo but the guy is unflappable. Has barely made contact for weeks and hits an absolute seed with 2 strikes. I’ll always have a soft spot for the guys who get booed by asshole fans….besides Joey Gallo lol,2022-09-21,23:02
"I think Stanton is a terrific Yankee and I didn't even support the trade. His injuries have prevented him from being a great Yankee, but the man hits when it counts and if he can carry us to a title the way A-Rod did in 09, he'll never be booed again. Not by any sane fan.",2022-09-22,04:17
Absolutely spot on . Yeah he’s streaky and injured but the guy doesn’t wilt or whine.,2022-09-21,13:26
To be fair when you are making that amount of money compared to others who whine about the boos it's a lot easier to shrug it off.,2022-09-21,09:57
We’re praising guys making $30M a year and underproducing for not lashing out at fans? Lol what a high bar.,2022-09-24,10:58
"Can the fans try not to do that with altuve and the other astros that feed off the boo's? 

It obviously doesn't work the same way for every player. Maybe try cheering altuve, itll catch him off guard and maybe he'll K for a change vs yankees pitching",2022-09-21,09:05

"Blue Jays fan here

He is the perfect hitter to protect the judge in the batting lineup",2022-09-21,14:16
"Safe to say that Giancarlo definitely knows the pressure of playing in a big market and not letting it get in his head. 

Couldn't say the same about Our Pal Joey G.",2022-09-21,15:23
I actually thought the boos were from a few bad strike calls he got at that AB but I could be wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️,2022-09-21,15:45
"I love Dongcarlo, but that won't stop me from being pissed at him when he goes 0-4 with 4k's 3 days in a row. I also don't want him off this team, and am always happy when he's raking.

I wish our hitting coaches would work with him to get him back to being more of a hitter than a slugger. It's great he hits the ball hard and all, but the guy should be like a .260-.280 hitter. He's that talented",2022-09-21,18:31
I will never boo Stanton after what he did last year. Certified Sox killer. That's good enough for me.,2022-09-21,19:20

"Those of us watching the Yankees from 1995-2013 were truly spoiled and privileged to get to watch the absolute greatest relief pitcher of all time do his thing.

I'll never forget being at the stadium before a game and getting to watch a bullpen session of his... and the sound the ball made when it collided with the catcher's mitt.

Congratulations Mo!!!",2019-01-22,19:34

Also I get to harvest a lot of salt from the baseball community over this, I'd make the Pacific Ocean into the Dead Sea.",2019-01-22,20:25

There is not a team in baseball with a story like the 2019 Yankees. We have overcome so much - even just today - and risen to the challenge every single time. Beyond risen, we have thrived. We blew the fucking doors off the AL East and that's just the beginning.

Every story needs a fitting ending. The ending for our story this year is with a fucking ring. And I am fully confident we will accomplish it. Fuck Houston, fuck Minnesota, fuck LA. Fuck the projections and the predictions and the statistics. This is our fucking year.",2019-09-19,21:30

"Quick question on post season tickets. I was selected for the postseason presale tickets and I am allowed to get a total of 8 tix. Would I be able to get 4 tickets to game 2 of the ALDS and 4 tickets to probably game 3 of the ALCS? Which if we face the Astros would be our first home game of that series. 

If I got tickets to game 3 of the ALCS and the Astros lost how would that work since game 1 and 2 would be the home games. Unless you purchase tickets by 1st Yankees home game, 2nd Yankees home game, etc.

"How magical will it be if these guys never get back to being decent hitters and spend the rest of their careers being paid by millions by their cheating owner to sit on the bench while they bring up players who are actually better than them when they don’t know what’s coming?

I’ll sign up to watch them sitting on the bench any day of the week.",2020-08-10,02:36
"Funny thing is, I don't believe for a second that this is because ""they don't know what's coming anymore."" Sign stealing is a huge advantage, but it's not a 100+ point swing on BA kind of swing unless you played your whole life with it and suddenly it's taken away. 

I think the whole offseason really did put them in a rut. Even without fans I think they're just distracted at being targeted and depressed that everyone hates them and that's even better.",2020-08-10,01:46

"Probably the weirdest division title to experience as fans. 

At no point did it feel like a huge goal. The season started so well that we spent most of the first half watching Houston because we already had the division locked up and were in bigger competition for the \#1 seed and home field. 

Then the season completely bottomed out and it was hard to even be excited about the division because it felt like we'd just lose in the 1st or 2nd round anyway, whether as a division winner or wild card. 

And then winning it suddenly felt inevitable again the last week or two, locking it up earlier than expected after that awful August and the lead being down to just 3 when playing Tampa.",2022-09-27,22:10

Instead, the Yanks finally woke up and realized Judge can’t do everything himself and finally started doing something.

I still have no faith that the Yanks can beat the trashtros in the ALCS, and the ALDS isn’t gonna be a cakewalk…. And I still don’t have faith in Cashman or especially Boone…. But at least disaster is averted.",2022-09-28,00:12

"He’s right, they beat us all around. I like Gerrit",2022-10-24,12:36
"How can we beat the Astros?

Cole: ""We need an entirely new team""",2022-10-24,12:41
Cole and Stanton need to instill the killer instinct in these losers.,2022-10-24,12:42
"Definitely were outmatched overall. Lineup was the most glaring spot to me.

I get the feeling our starters were mostly good throughout not just the playoffs, but the season in general. We also had many injuries in the bullpen, so that is an area where you have to imagine Yanks will be better next year. 

The lineup needs fixing.",2022-10-24,12:36
Cole speaks the truth. The Astros beat us in every facet of the game.,2022-10-24,12:32
Finally some honesty and accountability from a player.,2022-10-24,12:39
"If it weren't for the fact we were the doormat to their 2017 title, I wouldn't mind being beaten by Houston. It's the fact that they cheated, and now they are actually legitimately good and we can't beat them that bothers me.",2022-10-24,12:41
"Love how Cole talks to the media man, he says it like it is. Minus the obvious time he was caught with his pants down on Spider Tack, but beyond that he does it right",2022-10-24,13:48
A good honest answer,2022-10-24,12:54
Anyone else see Cole as a future YES network analyst?,2022-10-24,13:41
"Remember when Boone said last year that, “the rest of the league caught up to us”

And Brian Cashman’s solution to remedy that was to bring the same team back except add IKF and Donaldson?",2022-10-24,13:36
"Coles entire season upped him so many points in my book.

He didn't have his best season on the mound but he was a top tier  interview, all year.

Even though Judge leads in just about every stat, Cole and Stanton were the leaders this year.",2022-10-24,13:15
"Can we just take a second to appreciate that our two best performers in the playoffs were Cole and Stanton, the two highest paid guys on the squad. They stepped up as they should and earned their pay. 

Rest of the squad besides Judge, Nestor, and maybe Gleyber are completely expendible.",2022-10-24,13:50
Really like what he says. Being honest without calling out individuals.,2022-10-24,13:58
"Wow. There it is. Gerrit you fuckin showed up this year. Well done man. We feel you. Have no idea what it’s like in that clubhouse, but it doesn’t seem good. Glad to know these guys probably don’t like Cashman and co any more than we do.",2022-10-24,14:35

"Look he pisses me off a lot but he clearly cares and he's not one to beat around the bush, which I appreciate. Same with Stanton, they tell it how it is and they're honest. They need more of that.",2022-10-24,13:00
Cole should be GM he’d already be 10x better than Fraudman,2022-10-24,12:44
"Great reply from him. I think it’s more of a dig at the reporters than front office. Reporters ask players questions to stir up headlines and he’s right, he’s a player not a manager and the Astros outplayed us in every aspect.",2022-10-24,13:03
Well Cashman clearly doesn't have any expertise in General Managing either. It is simply beyond comprehension that Brian Cashman had first-hand experience working for Gene Michael and yet learned absolutely nothing from it.,2022-10-24,15:07
"Ouch.  Not great when players are starting hitting the manager and front office, but it needs to happen.

His comments on Judge are interesting.  Seems like he thinks he won't be coming back.",2022-10-24,12:33
Players are calling out coaching and general manager .  Hal take the hint,2022-10-24,13:36
They are a better team and it isn't particularly close,2022-10-24,13:36
Yankees were better at hitting 3ft pop ups than the Astros!,2022-10-24,16:04
"When the Astros made 1 mistake, the Yankees made 2. When the Yankees made 1, the Astros made 0, or the Astros made 1 too but the Yankees never made them pay for it (except when Framber threw the ball away). 

The Astros can capitalize on mistakes and the Yankees just can't/don't. That's the worst part, that the team pitched pretty well but not good enough. It's hard to win when you don't score, and when you score you don't field or pitch good and give the runs back.

On the box score these games were close, but watching the games, they kinda weren't. Yeah the Yankees mostly kept Altuve and Alvarez off the board but then gave up big hits to players who have been bad like Yuli Gurriel. You can't do that. The Astros weren't giving up hits to Kyle Higashioka or walking IKF.",2022-10-24,16:23
The Astros are better at everything. I told my family this would be a sweep and sure as shit it was,2022-10-24,17:09
He’s not wrong. Outplayed in every aspect of the game,2022-10-24,18:00
Say what you want about Cole but it’s refreshing that he’s not sugar coating this shit,2022-10-24,18:22
"That says it all, and where is that kind of honesty and accountability from Boone and the rest of the front office?",2022-10-24,19:09
"https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/batteam.shtml

If you check this site... the Yankees have almost 1400 strike outs this year. A team batting of 240. Compared to the dynasty and steroid Era average of about 1000 s.o / yr and a team BA closer to 280. 

Yankees need to get contact hitters. Need guys who grind at bats and wear out pitchers. Get gaps /doubles hitters that avg near 300 and 15-20 hr  rather than guys who hit 240 and 30 hr.",2022-10-24,18:43
Diplomatic yet spot on. I really like Cole.,2022-10-24,18:21
"When you spend $265 million in total payroll, and get swept decisively by a team that has done this 6 years straight and currently running a $193 million payroll, it comes down to approach and coaching.

Yes, the roster design is poor as well but it should at least be competitive. We're playing below the sum of our parts. I guess the $70 million difference is wrapped up in Britton, Chapman, and Donaldson but you'd then expect us to compete. Lose in 7 or whatever, but keep it close.

Instead, we struck out about as much as I would've up there. We were disjointed in defense. Our pitch selection was poor, and our pitchers were missing their spots.

The post-season is a bit of a crapshoot. Just look at the Dodgers. But it's really more about the teams that play more perfect than the others. This means limiting mistakes and taking advantage of the other team's mistakes. Simple as that.

The Astros knew they weren't getting tons of baserunners, so they made them count when they did.",2022-10-24,13:59
Gerrit Cole probably would be a better GM in acquiring or building rosters,2022-10-24,15:38
5th Straight October with agony for myself and the rest of this Yankee Fanbase. Brian Cashman really is great at finishing 4th every year but that’s no longer enough.  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting the same result. Time for some serious change up top.,2022-10-24,12:48

"Great and non boring answer. Cole was one of the few bright spots of this playoff run, game 3 included.",2022-10-24,13:41
"Perhaps the only man in this organization who carries himself like a New York Yankee 24/7, 365 days a year. No excuses, no spin, no “we could have won, but…,” no, just the man who was least responsible for our failures owning them like the professional that he is. Stanton shows a lot of this accountability as well, in fairness, but no one more so than Gerrit Cole. That’s a guy we want to go into battle with 10 times out of 10.",2022-10-24,14:25
"I’ve watched almost every Yankees game this year. I’m sorry to say I should have seen this coming. All through year the Yankees hit strings of games were no one could hit. multiple games. Everyone was cold for games on end. The only player on the team that had a .300 average was judge. When no one has the skill to hit .300 (I’d take .250 at this point) it is inevitable they will get dominated by good pitching. The art of hitting .300, hitting 25 homers, and getting 100 RBIs is over. IMO the emphasis on the wrong thing is killing the game. The old time players were just more skilled. Let’s start rewarding.300 hitters again please.",2022-10-24,14:35
"Man, before even talking about beating the Astros, I just want to see a team that gets pissed off after getting kicked in the teeth.  Whether its going down 0-2 in an ALCS or losing a midseason series to the Pirates, fucking get mad about it and show it.  And I dont mean just barking at the umps once every 3 or 4 weeks.  Whether the problem is FO, managerial, or players, I really don't care anymore.  I've had enough of this 'whatever happens, happens'.  Championship teams impose their will, and thats the opposite of what the Yankees have been for a long while.",2022-10-24,20:29
"Pitching was good overall. It’s been this way for what seems like the last 10 years- the bats go to sleep for the post season. 

Add to that Boone had many head scratching moves.",2022-10-24,13:34
Sometimes people need to understand that sabremetrics cannot explaon why one team can make anothet team their bitch?,2022-10-24,14:47
"Downvotes incoming I’m sure, but…

We’re not THAT bad, I think the Astros are just THAT good. 3 pennants in 6 years is dynasty level shit. We struggled a bit with Cleveland, but would we have gotten past the Mariners? Rays? Jays? I’m pretty sure we’d be WS-bound if somehow the Astros has gotten bounced by some other team. They’re just far and away the best team in the AL, probably in all of baseball. They’re scandal-proof, manager-proof. Even when Altuve shits the bed, they still have anywhere from 5 to 7 hitters who are among the best in baseball, always a threat for a big hit, the best framing catcher in baseball, best bullpen, and yeah, a stacked rotation with 4 guys who would be an ace on most teams. No one has that combination. They’re just that good.",2022-10-24,23:27
"Could Cole be calling out Boone and Cashman?  The Yankees had a 15.5 lead in the AL East at the All-Star break and ended up as a Wild Card.  The loss to Houston was only the most recent illustration of why this team failed down the stretch - out-managed, out-hit, out-pitched and the defense of the Yankees was awful.  I wish I knew how many different lineup configurations Boone used just in the postseason, let alone down the stretch - Peraza, for example, was brought up essentially because IKF was a failed experiment at SS, but he spent all but a game here or there warming the bench. I  remember only one appearance in the postseason. - even with IK's miscues costing the Yankees games.  Don't even get me started about the  revolving door at lead-off.",2022-10-25,03:58
He’s right - need more bats the most though. More home runs,2022-10-24,13:48
"Pitching depth at all levels, solutions at 3B &amp; SS, LF, more left bats, improved contact, better defense with less errors.",2022-10-24,12:57
"Here is my questions, when the Yankees were already down 2-0, and Mr. Cole loaded the bases, and was removed from the game, why did the fans give him an ovation?",2022-10-24,13:41
Second half of the lineup was automatic outs mostly. Judge Stanton and Gleyber forgot how to hit. IKF screwed us in the field over and over again.,2022-10-24,13:48
"translation ""I don't really care either way""",2022-10-24,19:07
"Resign Judge for big money short years… 40 mil, 4 years. If he gets an offer for longer, let him take it. Resign Benitendi and have a starting OF of Judge, Bader, Benitendi. If Judge leaves, start Cabrera. 
Trade Hicks, Torres, and Donaldson for any relievers you can get. Starting IF of IKF at 3, Perraza at SS, DJ at 2, Rizzo at 1. 
Starters, you resign Tallion and run it back. Then someone convince Cole that while strikeouts are cool, wasting pitches and constantly taking 0-2 counts to 3-2 only drives you out of the game after 5-6 innings. Pitch to contact and rack up complete games. 
Lastly, gotta find a real catcher. Maybe you package Higgy and one/two of the infielders to get a real catcher.",2022-10-25,01:37

"With heavy hearts we are saddened to announce the passing of our youngest son, Miller. He was 14 years old and has left us far too soon after falling ill along with several other family members while on vacation. We have so many questions and so few answers at this point, but we do know that he passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of Friday, March 21st. 

Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile. He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.

We are so thankful to all who have reached out to offer support and encouragement during this difficult time and we are confident our faith, family, and friends will help us navigate this unimaginable loss. Our prayers go out to Miller's teammates and friends, as well as to all other families who have lost a child far too soon as we share their grief.

"When I was growing up my mom was friends with one of the other moms from our Catholic parish/school. Let’s call her Mrs. Smith. The Smiths had two kids, a boy and a girl, a few years older than me, but only the girl went to the same school as my sisters and I. The boy (the oldest) had some “issues,” as it was described at the time and which I have since learned was either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. They managed it as well as possible with medication and other treatments and for the most part this guy lived a *relatively* normal life, but there was always an undercurrent of concern for him whenever he was around socially (infrequently) or came up. (This was in the mid-to-late 90s, not like a real high-awareness era for mental health.)

Some time in my early-20s, we learned one morning that the Smith’s son had very suddenly died. It was not clear at the time whether it was self-inflicted, overdose, sudden illness, or what. It was very sad of course and I felt bad for my mom’s friend and the rest of their family but that was the extent of my reaction to it. 

This was over the summer. Months later on Christmas Eve I was leaving Mass with my mom and we ran into Mr and Mrs Smith on the way out and mom started talking with Mrs Smith, leaving me standing there semi-awkwardly with her husband. Mr Smith was a big, taciturn guy, a manual laborer of some kind, and even though we had technically known each other for years we had no actual relationship. 

Then Mrs Smith mentioned, to my mom, how it been rough so far that year since it was their first Christmas without their son. 

And this, just hearing it out loud, *broke* Mr Smith. 

He turned to me, some 22 year old kid he barely knew, and almost literally collapsed into my arms, just bawling, right there in the back of church. I caught him, and held him up while he let it all out, at least for a few minutes until he got it together enough for his wife to lead him out and to the car.  

Like I said, he was a big guy- six-three or six-four at least, and burly- and so am I, but the thing I noticed immediately, and have never forgotten, and never will: it felt like he weighed *nothing.* Like he’d been hollowed out. 

RIP to Miller, and condolences and prayers for his family, who will need them.",2025-03-23,14:34
"Many people criticized the move use Garcia as an opener specifically because this left Jordan Montgomery in position to start the critical game 4. However, Gumby stepped up in a big way and pitched an excellent 4 innings before giving way to the bullpen. Only Cole has given us a better start this postseason, as Tanaka and Happ struggled.

The game is still being played but if the Yankees do win, Jordan Montgomery deserves a ton of credit.",2020-10-08,21:46
Thank you Gumby!!,2020-10-08,21:51
Credit to Higgy for calling a good game behind Gumby as well,2020-10-08,22:11
I don’t usually feel proud of our players because they’re grown ass millionaires but idk why I definitely felt proud of Gumby tonight. He could’ve sucked tonight and honestly no one would’ve blamed him. The fact that he bent twice but refused to break was for some reason extremely touching. Maybe I’m getting old.,2020-10-08,22:29
Battled today and did what was needed of him.,2020-10-08,22:18
The idea of Gumby starting today scared the crap out of me. He has been very inconsistent and the fear that bad Gumby would show up made me super nervous. But he did darn well and we managed to force game 5. The team may be able to overcome mismanagement again.,2020-10-08,22:32
"Gotta admit, I had no faith in him. Glad I was proven wrong. Good shit, Gumby.",2020-10-08,22:30
"I loved the Monty start for game four before we even lost game 2. I even said on this site, glad we used Happ in game 2 so Monty gets the start in game 4. He's not overpowering but people don't seem to barrel the bat on him. Great job today. Now it's a one game series.",2020-10-08,22:56
"I would give this an award if I had one. It cannot be stated enough how huge it was for Monty to step up like he did. It reminded me of Pettite.

We Yankees fans know there's a moment where the player ""earns"" their pinstripes. I'd say this was Monty's moment.",2020-10-08,23:53
"I was actually more confident in Gumby compared to both Garcia and Tanaka (vs Morton). Like a weird, calming confidence. Probably because the match up. Gumby has been hurt a majority of the time here, so it makes sense people sleep on him.",2020-10-08,23:01

"I thought maybe he could give us like 3 runs over 4 innings or maybe 4 runs over 5 and we could battle through it and survive to at least make it a game in the later innings. 

But 1 over 4 was absolutely excellent. Getting out of that 2nd &amp; 3rd no one out was huge. Could've been no runs if we weren't stupid shifting in a double-play situation.",2020-10-09,00:11
"When I watch him pitch Gumby is a knock off version of pettite to me.  I felt confident tonight, I just pretended it was Andy.",2020-10-09,00:03

Gumby pitched well under pressure. Especially since he hasn’t pitched in two weeks. I hope this gives him some confidence and keeps his place in the rotation for next season,2020-10-09,00:04
Still think he should’ve been pulled after 3 but I’ll take 4 would love to see Cole go 5 innings of shut out ball tomorrow,2020-10-09,00:28
"I loved every second of it. After being considered a maybe as a number 5 starter, proving himself but still being doubted, having to get Tommy John....it was simply wonderful to see him pitch so well tonight. His pitching got us out of jams, not strategy or luck. He quieted several hot bats. Great start all around, and any acclaim is well deserved",2020-10-09,00:38
Gumby fucking balled out tonight,2020-10-09,00:40
Thank you for proving me wrong and having a great game Monty!,2020-10-09,01:01
I think Happ shoulda started that game TBH like he has his whole career,2020-10-09,03:08
"To me, he wasn’t getting enough credit at all. He was my hero for the game and saving the season for another day. I get it, 4 innings isn’t long, and he gave up the game’s only run, but the game always hinged on his performance. We knew we had Green, Britton, and Chapman all ready and they could give us at least 4 innings if not 5. If Montgomery goes out there and throws a stinker, gives up 5 in 3 innings, we are screwed. He did exactly what we needed him to do. Sure it would have been awesome if he gave us 5, but he was the biggest reason we won the game (IMO) and was the biggest reason I was so nervous headed into the game.",2020-10-09,03:58
"One thing I found really interesting is during the regular season we saw two Gumbys: lockdown, lights out Gumby, and bad Gumby. Last night there were still people on base but he stayed under control and got those huge outs. Incredible performance",2020-10-09,09:08
I'm a fan of Gumby since he appeared in the big league roster. Real Andy Pettite vibes.,2020-10-09,09:46
I doubted him. I truly did. Monty said shut up and sit down.,2020-10-09,10:47
I've loved Gumby since his Carolina days. Glad he's getting his moment.,2020-10-09,10:50
"It's been a couple years, but he was pretty solid as a rookie. Maybe people just forgot since he's been hurt, but I always thought he was pretty good.",2020-10-09,11:24

"I was skeptical, I was worried, and I was even a little angry. I said, ""what has Montgomery ever done to make me feel good about him starting this game?"" And now, if you asked me that same question I would say ""he stepped up when it mattered most, in the biggest start of his life so far, and got the job done. He showed poise, promise, and deserves respect."" He made us proud!! Go Yankees!",2020-10-09,12:17
Gumbyyyy!!!,2020-10-09,12:21

They handled the stretches against tough teams like Houston admirably and did their jobs against the struggling teams in their way. Both on the field and in the schedule, they’ve taken advantage of every single opportunity they’re provided and every single mistake their opponents make.

This season has been nothing short of a wet dream that I just wish had no end. But with the ASB coming up soon, it’s going to be important for them to carry over this momentum and keep it going. They’ve steadily been on pace for the best season in Yankees history.

&gt;I tell ya he was 6'6 if he was afoot.

&gt;In sensing my presence, he let out a great bellow. 

&gt;I said, ""EASY THERE, DELLIN""

&gt;And then, as i watched him throw warmup tosses, I noticed something was obstructing his breathing.

&gt;Where i was standing, i was able to see STRAIGHT into the eye of the great starter (reliever, whatever).

&gt;All the sudden, something led me to the mound and i was right face to face with his mouth. 

&gt;I can barely see from beer cans being tossed down on top of me, but i knew something was there. 

&gt;So i reached my hand in, felt around and PULLED out the obstruction.

"I agree with everything, except for ""one if the greatest hitting seasons of all time."" I know everyone fools themselves into thinking that a .260 hitter in today's game is a great batting average, so I definitely give Judge props for being able to put up the power numbers he did while still keeping his average over .300.
However, to say that a .311 average on 177 hits is one of the best ""hitting"" seasons of all time is a little sad, to be honest.

I love that he is clean and he had the season he had doing it the ""right"" way. 20 years ago, I believe his average woulda been .370+. Todays game is so laser-focused on all the minutiae of the stats that sabermetrics gives, that the ""art"" of hitting has almost been forgotton.

If this was like 2001 or 2092, he could have very well been the first player to hit over .400 since Ted Williams, and still put up those amazing power numbers.",2022-10-14,21:34

"Dream weaver! To my memory, today’s 8th inning is the first time he’s “struggled” in a save opportunity (I’m pretty sure he’s never given up more than one baserunner in an inning in a save opportunity before today, but correct me if I’m wrong). And he didn’t have his strikeout stuff today either. So it was super encouraging to see him keep his composure enough to finish out the 8th and come back for the 9th. Seeing him grind through a few less easy outs and still get the 1 run save makes me really hopeful for his future high leverage appearances and/or days when he doesn’t have his best stuff.",2024-10-09,22:39

"Kay was saying that the fans were all into booing Altuve, and were almost giving Bregman, Correa, and Gurriel a free pass. Yeah Altuve took the MVP from Judge, but they were still on the team who cheated their way over us in ALCS.

so here's my ""fuck Bregman, Correa, and Gurriel"" too.",2021-05-05,13:09
"I really do wonder how awkward this stuff is for Gerrit. In fact, I wonder how much complicity any of the pitchers for the Astros had in this system. Obviously it wasn't to their direct benefit - they would've never taken at bats during home games - but they did still benefit from the run support that the cheating gave them to work with. And you could very easily argue - as Trevor Bauer did long before this controversy was even revealed - that, if the Astros were cheating so blatantly in one way, odds are they were cheating in other ways as well. Cheaters tend to look for every thing they can exploit, not just one thing.",2021-05-05,13:05

But when you’re the guy doing the most talking, you can’t then go dead silent when things go bad(aka get caught blatantly cheating).

"Gary Sanchez has had one of the most up and down careers of any athlete in the last thirty years. When he is at his best he is shattering records, at his worst he can single-handedly lose you a series. Many of us thought that it was a lack of consistency, or maybe even a lack of effort after he experiences a deep run of success and he grows complacent; but is there something more here? Something deeper? Is his desire to avoid playing like ass simply a side effect of an even stronger desire for Booty?

Gary Sanchez made his MLB debut in 2015, going 0-2 in his first career game. He was given an opportunity to win the backup catcher role in 2016, that he lost to future brawling ally vs Miguel Cabrera Austin Romine. Gary was promoted for good finally on August 3rd, 2016.

In August of 2016, there were rumors flying that Jennifer Lopez, noted Yankees' fan and thickness ambassador, was on the outs in her relationship of 2 years with then-current boyfriend Casper Smart. On August 16th a report came out that they had split up, and Casper was seen out and about in Hollywood with Nicole Schezerzneeergniner of the Pussycat Dolls. Later that night Gary Sanchez posted the first two homer night of his career. He would go on to win AL Player of the Week, hitting .523 and winning Player of the Week the following week and Player of the Month. That season Gary became the first player in MLB history with at least 11 home runs and 31 hits in his first 23 career games, and became the fastest player in history to hit 19 home runs. Despite playing in less than 60 games, Gary nearly won the AL Rookie of the Year award. Was a desire to impress the now available Lopez what drove his Herculean effort to keep the 2016 Yankees relevant? 

Fast forward to 2017 and Gary is coming into the season with the weight of New York on his shoulders. He struggled mightily to start the year, and despite a strong enough rally to get himself a spot in the Allstar Game and Home Run Derby, he was fading hard by July and early August. Was it the expectations that wore him down? Or was it that Jlo had since found love in a former Yankee star in February, causing him to spiral?

Ironically, Gary's struggles only abated after he attended a dinner with mentor Alex Rodriguez, and, you guessed it, his current girlfriend Jennifer Lopez. Immediately following the dinner Gary hit .471 with three home runs the following 5 games, crediting Ms. Lopez with giving him ""Positive advice and a positive experience."" He also spoke of her as a great actress, a compliment as wide reaching and generous as an Angel Hernandez strike zone for one of the 11 pitchers left in baseball he doesn't hold contempt for. Gary would go on to win the 2017 Silver Slugger for Catcher.

As injuries reached him, as well as time away from Jennifer while she strengthened her bond with Arod, Gary suffered a terrible 2018. Gary had a bounce back 2019, hitting 34 home runs and benefiting from a much healthier season and a trimmer body, though some experts, (I guess just me, so *all* experts), speculate that his renewed power came from renewed hope after an April bombshell by Jose Conseco revealed potential cheating rumors that threatened the union of the abbreviation power couple of Arod and Jlo.

In 2020 Arod and Jlo doubled down on their wedding, saying it was coming, just delayed due to the pandemic. This possibly triggered one of the worst seasons in Yankees' baseball history, including a .147 average and -0.3 War in just 49 games.

Gary came into camp of 2021 in good shape again, and did have a good first two games before slumping again. Hope arrived, however, in the second half of April in the form of the announcement of Arod and Jen's separation. Gary finished his April batting .190, then batted .213 with four homers in May, followed by a June where his is currently batting over .300 for the month with six home runs and 13 RBI's, with a week still remaining.

Further studies will need to be conducted with the return of Dare Devil and noted Red Sox lover Ben Afflec into her life, but as a Yankees' fan Jeniffer Lopez needs to truly ask herself; is a fling with an ex really worth throwing away one of the greatest hitting catchers of all time? Would her time not be better spent in the arms of a younger man who could give her not only the wedding ring that has alluded her for so long, but a World Series ring powered by love?
