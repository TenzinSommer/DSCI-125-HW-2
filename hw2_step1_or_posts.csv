"So glad I got to share this with my 11 year old son.  He was too young to really understand 2014.  The O's lose every game we go to.  I don't think he has seen a win in 3 or 4 years(over a dozen games).  Finally, finally finally have something joyful to share with him!!

Oh and 6 days a week he has some sort of baseball activity of his own.  Thank god Wednesdays are his night off.  Lets fucking go!!!!",2021-05-05,18:13

"Couldn‚Äôt love this more! The only downside was Garceau announcing it. I wish Thorne had been there to make the call. Garceau‚Äôs inability to hype a moment is single A level announcing. Aside from my Garceau rant, this was an incredible start and one wild pitch away from a Perfect Game. These things haven‚Äôt happened with the Orioles since ‚Äò95 and Ripken or ‚Äò14 and the Young double. This is what keeps me hooked year after year with the Orioles. I know we are in a rebuild, but to see a start like that and get taken back to my 90‚Äôs teams with Mussina dominating, I love it. I hope we don‚Äôt go the Bedard route and trade him. He seems like a front of the rotation guy for years to come and he‚Äôs not headed to free agency. Him along with Mancini, Mullins, Hays, Kremer and guys just waiting in the wings, we may not be too far off.",2021-05-05,19:57

What a remarkable year, about as fun as a non-playoff season could ever be. Gunnar and Adley as the face of this team moving forward makes me so proud and excited. This team feels even more promising than the machado/jones/markakis &amp; friends era ever did.

"Hey. Listen. As a 30 years jays fan, I hate you guys. Every year you shouldn‚Äôt be relevant you manage to somehow show up for the games that matter and fuck everyone. Whether that‚Äôs a run for the wild card or just the playoffs in general. We have players over the years on either side that have made a real rivalry and it‚Äôs always fun to watch. 

That said, what you guys did this year deserve some serious props. It was actually a wonder to watch in utter terror because it seemed unstoppable. And who you did it with is fantastic. 

Also, god bless for pitching to judge the way he was supposed to be pitched to. I get the Yankee fans are pissed because since you were eliminated you are supposed to be obligated to pitch him meatballs to break records. Fuck that and way to stick to your guns. 

All I can say is, despite how it ended, celebrate setting a record that hasn‚Äôt been done in over 120 years! 

We still got a few last games together, but if I don‚Äôt pop over here till next season, honestly, congrats and we will see you next year!",2022-10-02,22:06

"Back in January when the O's traded for Burnes, the organization wanted one thing out of him; excellence when it mattered most. Holy shit did he meet expectations. Even with a rough August he bounced back and won AL pitcher of the month in September. And in the playoffs? 8 IP 1 ER. The definition of dominance. He was a true leader on this team, and you truly did feel how his presence changed the rotation. He did what the organization wanted him to do and arguably more. 

Chances are he doesn't re-sign with us, so wherever he ends up going, I hope he knows that Baltimore will always love him. Thank you so much Burnes.",2024-10-02,20:54

"He delivered everything we ever could have hoped for and then a whole lot more beyond that, not missing a single start and throwing 200 innings. He hit some struggles and he made the right adjustments needed to pull through, which is huge. And he was a postseason machine. Elias certainly brought in the right guy for this intentioned role of a #1 starter. It's a bummer it ended on the note it did, but holy heck was Burnes fun to watch pitch. That was definitely a highlight of 2024 season to me and I'm glad I got to see him live 3 times this season.",2024-10-02,21:02
"A professional that rose above and beyond the occasion when the pressure was on, in spite of his struggles since the asb. That performance absolutely raised his stock back to where it belonged. If it‚Äôs not us, I hope some team backs up the brinks truck and he enjoys plenty of playoff success.",2024-10-02,21:08
He came as advertised. Sad we couldn‚Äôt muster up a single run for the guy yesterday.,2024-10-02,21:26
"Absolutely to all of that.
Here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt get. We faced one of the best pitching staffs in all of baseball this year. We were riddled with injuries and we hobbled into the playoffs and gave up 3 runs in 2 games. Hence we were at their caliber, but we bit down on a towel all year with anxiety. So next year we have a healthy pitching staff and we could still get beat in 2 by 1 run in each game. I can‚Äôt live in that reality.",2024-10-02,21:17
"Aside from one bad month, Burnesy was as good as advertised. Pitched like a true ace in a must-win game.

He deserves better than this team. So does Mullins.,2024-10-02,21:13
"This guy was one of the best pitchers this team has had in the last 25 years, and they let him down massively.

33 starts, and he pitched at least six innings 24 times.  When is the last time we ever had that?  That includes a 17-game consecutive stretch of going at least six innings.

Almost a quarter of his starts we gave him ZERO run support, including four of his last eight.  His average outing took him into the 7th inning, at 6.1 innings per start.",2024-10-02,22:48

He won't re-sign with us. I don't blame him. Hopefully someone else worth their salt will. Godspeed Mr. Burnes,2024-10-02,21:27
"The statement that Burnes just made to the media about the team further illustrates the kind of professional that he is. I can only imagine that he was frustrated with how his game went, but the guy is all class:

He's going to have a lot of teams making him offers in a few months. And if/when he signs elsewhere, that is going to be a *huge* loss that I have no idea how the team will manage to fill. I hope we can keep him in Baltimore, but just about every competing team is probably going to try for him as there just aren't many SPs out there like him.",2024-10-02,21:54

"There was discussion about this, but not sure he‚Äôs the LT contract we want. I love what he did for us this season, but how many seasons does he have like that?",2024-10-02,21:45
"He is the best pitcher I‚Äôve ever seen in an O‚Äôs jersey. I vaguely remember the tail end of the Mussina years, so I don‚Äôt have the best frame of reference on that, but it really feels like Burnes was the most talented O‚Äôs pitcher since Palmer. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he leaves, but there is really zero reason we shouldn‚Äôt be able to at least match any offer he gets, unless it‚Äôs an absurd Dodgers Ohtani type offer that eclipses $50 million a year. Anything $40 million or below we should absolutely match, and if he still decide to walk then it is what it is.",2024-10-02,22:24

8 innings of one run ball in a playoff game deserves a win in my book. I was at the game and it was electric watching him. He‚Äôll be missed and it‚Äôs a shame we don‚Äôt like to make major moves in the offseason. Maybe new ownership changes things but time will tell.,2024-10-02,22:59

Will always root for him after this year whereever he goes (unless it‚Äôs the Yankees in which case I‚Äôll just be indifferent)",2024-10-03,06:26
"Man I hope we keep him and Papa Ruby opens up the check book. 

I can see the Yankees making a big play for Burnes. 

They have the correct change and it hurts one of their biggest division rivals. 

Hell, their downside is minimal because even if they don‚Äôt sign him, then they at least drive up his price - another way to hurt a team in your division. 

All that said, I‚Äôm hopeful that we‚Äôre going to keep him because he‚Äôs pretty damn close to being a generational talent. 

I can see O‚Äôs management justifying not signing him because of the dollars that will be involved - it just may be too rich for them, i.e., needing $‚Äôs to sign Gunnar, Tony et al and thinking that a healthy Bradish = Burnes. 

Hate to say this, but the Yankees winning it all should light a competitive fire under the collective asses of management.",2024-10-03,09:49

Good thing for him it was only one season wasted in Baltimore. Mussina wasted how many years before he went to the Evil Empire? At least Cal got one ring.,2024-10-03,18:01
"Well said. 

Our boys let him down constantly. He carried us all season and didn‚Äôt leave with injury like almost every other pitcher. He was an absolute choice trade made by Elias. If it weren‚Äôt for an implosion on offense and infield defense we may have given him a shot at a series. What a heartbreaker‚Ä¶that was like losing to KC in the AFC champ game. Brutal. 

Side note: adley needs to come tf back. They gave him waaaaay too far of a leash for being absolutely worthless at the plate. Starting him at DH pissed me off, Rivera was actually hitting. Also pitch matching with a shaky bullpen is a dumb idea. Hyde irritated me to the freaking core.",2024-10-03,19:24
"If we had given him decent run support, he‚Äôd have won 20 games.  Doubt he would come back even if the deal was competitive for that reason alone.",2024-10-02,21:43

I remember more in 1969, more how upset my Dad was...I was seven, and I think I went to my first game that year.  In 1970, as a kid, I guess I expected the Orioles to always be in the World Series, and doesn't every team have four 20 game winners? 

In 1971, that was painful, but the expectation was, we'd be back, we were one of the best organizations in baseball.

1979, I was a junior in HS, Dad had two tickets to each home game, he took me to Game 7, to this day, I hate the Pittsburgh Pirates and ""We Are Family""...ugh...

1983, I was a junior in college far away from Baltimore, so, we'd go down to the student union to watch the games.  I spent the summer in school doing research, and only got back home to see one game on my birthday, August 5, 1983.  We got tickets in the LF bleachers as the place was packed.  The O's were down 4 -2 in the bottom of the ninth, and hit 5 singles, several with two outs, to win 5 - 4.

This really feels like that. The Orioles are good, really good, and they're playing like they expect to win.

"Adam Jones' take:
 &gt; I'm glad for Manny for defending himself. Screw it. Defend yourself. If somebody's trying to hurt you maliciously, you go out there and you defend yourself. I hope the league goes and sees and reviews exactly what happened, because you can't go out there when you've got a weapon or something at 100 miles per hour, you don't have to hit and you're trying to hurt somebody. That's not part of the game. If you have to hit? All right, cool. The tables can be turned, and he can get his fair share at the hitting.",2016-06-07,23:49

"A buddy and I went to the stadium Friday against the Rays. We each went to three vendors in three parts of the stadium (six transactions total). Every single one of them discretely selected a 25% tip themselves before turning the screen around for us to pay. Every time we had to hit the ""back"" button and start over and change to a zero tip. I even told the beer guy ""I like you but I'm not tipping you nine dollar for two beers, are you crazy."" 

This is out of control. I had the same experience earlier in the season and fell for the hustle, not realizing what had happened until I saw my credit card statement. That time, I tracked down Levy's controller and insisted on a refund (which they did provide). So they're aware of this. I knew better than to fall for it yesterday. 

This is a huge huge scam and the people in charge know exactly what's happening. Does anyone have any plans to address it? I love the O's, but I gotta say, it really, really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. And I hate having to warn my out-of-town visitors who I take to the stadium that they now have to watch out for scammers.


Edit: to clarify this isn't me unknowingly selecting a 25 percent tip. Seems like there's a lot of misunderstanding. This is the employees slyly pushing the 25 percent option themselves and not saying anything. ",2024-09-07,13:34
"it‚Äôs good to vent here and let others know about how concessions at the park are conducting their business. definitely recommend you and anyone else that‚Äôs experienced this to call or email the O‚Äôs about this though. even better if you‚Äôre a season ticket holder to call your rep and let them know.

"This year ive been double charged a few times throughout the park doing almost exactly this. Each time I call the bank to dispute, they ask ""did you call the stadium?"" Haha... How laughable. 

Went to the Monday day game (labor day) I asked  the beer guy to have the scanner back so I can tip him. He told me he auto selected 20%. That's not okay. 

Yes an issue for sure.",2024-09-07,14:13
"I think the self check out kiosk default to 25%, you have to select 0%, they're betting on you just selecting next.

And somehow every person doing the beer checkout takes FOREVER, scrolling down for what feels like min.

"It‚Äôs awful, and it goes on everywhere these days. I just saw Pearl Jam at Wrigley last week. Huge line to grab a beer. Card only, no option to pay cash. I swipe my card and the lady holds up a reader with super small print of tip options (in the dark). Had to move quickly with long line behind me. Pressed what I thought what the lowest tip amount. Turns out lowest option was 20% or some nonsense. I paid $48 for two beers.

To be fair, it‚Äôs my own fault for putting myself in that position, however they bank on people rushing through the line and not paying attention. It‚Äôs predatory. If your not on top of it, they get you bad. I will certainly be paying better attention from here on out.",2024-09-07,13:46
"Tangential: NYT‚Äôs The Daily had an episode about the tipping / auto tipping / tipping for menial actions. It‚Äôs not going away. In fact is building up.

Some restaurants or similar type places tried No Tipping trying to pay their employees a higher wage. Those companies in general went out of business.

I stopped buying beer at games when they passed $10 and asking for tips. Not worth it,2024-09-07,14:27
Completely agree. It's a complete scam for 25% to be selected without the purchasers consent. I am going to email the O's expressing my concern and encourage everyone to do the same.,2024-09-07,14:51
"Sorry but going to all professional sports and concerts etc are horrible from the time you have plan on sitting in traffic being robbed to park, concessions are insane, tickets can be outrageous, we just enjoy the games on television without the loud drunks, idiots in lines etc",2024-09-07,16:08
"Brace yourselves this is gonna be a long one. There are multiple shady practices at play here and it goes *wayyyy* beyond the vendors. 

1) Markups are *beyond* ridiculous

Most items are marked up 100% or more. I was at a game in July and paid $6 for a 20oz soda and $18 for a personal pizza. For comparison a 20oz soda at any convenience store is usually around $2.75. A personal pizza at High's is like $8 or $9. 

2) Out-of-control tipping culture

No further explaanation needed. We all know it's crazy. 

3) Not accepting cash

This plays a bigger role than you might think. OPACY says it's to ""limit touch points"", but that's just their public-facing reason and it's mostly BS. Just think about it. This was never a concern before COVID. When the shutdown happened, card and other non-cash payments just took off. Businesses started using this new trend as a way to exploit consumers, which leads me to my next point.

4) POS (point-of-sale) systems

The POS system used at OPACY can only ask for tips with card and other non-cash payments. When you combine the crazy markups, current tipping culture and refusing cash payments, the vendors are basically printing their own money.

Like I said, there's *wayyyy* more to blame than just the vendors.",2024-09-07,15:49
"This is not a scam, this is not certain vendors being shady. The union that the vendors belong to negotiated that the default tip selection would be 25%. Source: My dad is a beer vendor at Camden Yards.",2024-09-07,13:53
Thanks for the heads up. Headed to a game soon so I‚Äôll be on my toes.,2024-09-07,14:21
Meanwhile at the ravens games the concession worker has a cup next to the register and says ‚Äúif you put a $10 bill in this cup I‚Äôll give $20 worth of food‚Äù,2024-09-07,15:38
Not tipping related but we‚Äôre at the game now and my wife just used O‚Äôs pay and it said ‚Äúpayment failed‚Äù so she scanned it again. Now we see 2 charges of the exact same amount a minute apart on my Chase account. Not necessarily a scam but crappy technology for sure. Hopefully one will drop off before it posts. But I have better ways of spending of spending my time than dealing with getting it fixed.,2024-09-07,16:14
"Nothing to add except that I, too, was at the game yesterday and this happened. I was on autopilot, and only after it was over that I thought ""I think she pre-selected 20%.""

"My favorite scam at Camden Yards was the enterprising employee who offered me a cash price of $20 for $45 worth of food.  Usually I would feel guilty about this, but the food was terrible and wasn‚Äôt worth $5.",2024-09-07,18:43
"This is why I miss events accepting cash. I was at a major concert at the Seahawks Stadium last weekend and they have these drink vendors where you scan your card before they let you pick your drink. Then you pick your drink and leave, but no prices are listed anywhere. I spent $20 on two bottles of water, which I conveniently  didn‚Äôt  receive a transaction notice on for like 2 hours. Paying cash should always be an option.",2024-09-07,15:15
"I regularly tip 25-30% at small businesses I like to support in person. But if I‚Äôm in a stadium I‚Äôm not tipping a red cent. There‚Äôs not a single reason for a beer to be $15 dollars. Stadium food and beer pricing in itself is a scam, before you even get to the employees putting in a 25% tip without you knowing (which should be a fireable offense).",2024-09-07,17:10
Another data point from the game today: At the local fry place I got the crab dip fries which have a list price of $18. I saw the cashier punching a bunch of buttons quickly and thought he might be adding tip. But I did the math and with my discount and tax he actually selected 0% tip. I mean if he would‚Äôve flipped the screen around and asked me to tip I might‚Äôve. But I think sometimes they do 0 tip just to keep the line moving.,2024-09-07,18:32

I‚Äôve been charged for the wrong more expensive canned different drink multiple times through the ballpark app Os pay system. It‚Äôs only a $2-4 more but it does add up. I feel like it‚Äôs on purpose because they‚Äôre different colors and you can clearly see what I‚Äôm grabbing.,2024-09-07,13:56
"PSA: If a vendor does this to you, where they pre-select a tip % and they never show you a screen indicating that they have selected a tip % for you for your bill, you can and should dispute that portion of the charge with your financial services provider. I can tell you with certainty that if this happens enough and people dispute these charges enough, the vendor will hear about it from said financial services companies. Chargebacks are a very big deal to credit card-issuing companies and they WILL address the issue with the vendor if they receive a volume of complaints about them.",2024-09-07,15:28
"I get tipping the beer vendors in the stands and the roof deck bars, but the default expectation to tip at a concession stand is egregious and needs to be removed from the payment system",2024-09-07,15:24

Yes everyone takes forever and a day with the self check out machines and they can be a bit confusing. I liked it better before all this. For context im 31.

"I had this same issue when I went. My uncle and I went to get some lemonades at the stand next to dippin dots on Eutaw street and after waiting 5 minutes for a 7.50$ lemonade that was mostly ice and not filled to the top, the young girl at the register has a less than welcoming attitude and the screen was locked onto a tip. My uncle who is 68 tried to change it but couldn‚Äôt figure out how to so we ended up getting frustrated and paying the tip, even though I would have given that girl a negative tip. She didn‚Äôt even say anything to us except ‚Äúits gonna ask you to pay the tip‚Äù or something like that, like it was her sole priority.",2024-09-07,14:26

"I used to work for a company that sold Point of Sales systems to restaurants and I asked my boss about this and if i remember correctly a lot of the new systems come with the tip feature automatically programmed in. My guess is it would cost extra to have it removed, and these are systems that for a small restaurant can cost $3000-$5000, for a stadium as large as Camden yards I can imagine it would be a stupid amount for the POS (point of sales not prices of shit) alone.",2024-09-07,13:55

I pulled the bottle from the cooler and they turned the payment machine around, lo and behold a tiny little ‚Äú20% tip‚Äù was pre-chosen for me. How NICE of them to presume. I was not the sucker.

Autoselecting the tip is called fraud. It‚Äôs either fee you disclose upfront for service or you have to let people select.,2024-09-08,05:20
"Can I ask why I am tipping someone for taking two steps to get drink out of a cooler and then two steps back to the counter? They did nothing that makes the experience better.

The whole purpose of tipping is to say thank you for making the experience you had better, not to supplement the low pay that the employer is providing despite charging 5x the amount over the normal price of the item.",2024-09-08,06:44
"This explains a lot! I brought my baseball crazy 7 and 9 year old to Camden Yards last year for their first MLB game. Drive 4 hours from central Virginia. Grabbed food as we went in. 2 bottles of water looked like they came from a multipack, 3 basic hot dogs and 3 small bags of chips like you would get at Walmart cost me $85. Ruined my day because I was too nervous to buy anything else for how much it would cost me. All I did when I told people about the game was how insane the cost of things was inside the stadium. I‚Äôve talked many of them into not going themselves for the same reason.",2024-09-08,07:34
"Same thing happens to me every time I go.  First time I emailed management and they said ‚Äúthey are aware of the problem ‚Äú, apologized and said they would speak with their concessions management.  It‚Äôs horse shit, I‚Äôll tip the guys walking the stairs but why the fuck would I tip someone to hand me a lemonade?  Just more reason for people to stay at home and watch from their couches.",2024-09-08,09:26
"Roughly about a month 1/2 ago, went up to the clubhouse and got some popcorn/ refreshments as the game started. Around the bottom of the second inning, I walked up to the empty bar and ordered 2 beers. The older lady behind the bar was grumpy.

In other words, some form of assistance would have saved 45 seconds of her mumbling &amp; repeating herself. After that, she flips the screen to me to tip. I select zero. She then says ‚Äúyou know some of us work for tips‚Äù. Responded that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not responsible for your employer not paying you more‚Äù and walked out. 
Also- I hate the pre authorization of $25 on each purchase. It all goes away once it‚Äôs cleared with the bank but I hate seeing hundreds of dollars pending",2024-09-08,09:51
"I agree.
I'm going to let my Orioles rep know, so hopefully they can curb that promptly.",2024-09-07,13:52
It‚Äôs BS,2024-09-07,13:50
I only tip servers.   They make less the minimum wages.   The guy at my Starbucks that makes over $15 an hour but can't make my coffee to taste the same over 2 days in a row isn't getting a tip.,2024-09-07,20:52
" The pre set is 20% but every vender I used today, at least 4 different ones, all pointed out/referenced the tip is set to 20% and asked if I would like to change it.",2024-09-07,20:30

"I was at that game too!  Someone outside Camden Yards was selling peanuts for 5 bucks and I meant to see how much it was inside and forgot to do so.  

The flip side, off topic, friend of mine that flew into town from the Midwest and had never seen Camden Yards was very impressed with the stadium.",2024-09-08,07:01
That‚Äôs why I always go the stand themselves. Why should I pay a tip when I can walk there myself and open my can myself? I never understood the vendors in the stands or walking around. The guys on the concourse just add traffic into the people who just randomly stop. And the ones in the stand I find distracting.,2024-09-08,07:43
"All of the vendors do this. I got my nephew a soft serve and they did the same thing, I proudly pressed no tip lol. I‚Äôm not tipping $2 for an ice cream cup.",2024-09-08,09:24

I always ask when it happens, ‚Äòwhy not include 15 &amp; 20% as well?‚Äô They respond ‚Äòit‚Äôs not set up that way.‚Äô It also doesn‚Äôt offer a no tip option. So frustrating! &amp; yet I always pay it cuz it‚Äôs a local restaurant I Ike. Still - it is a scam.

I had one guy charge me $34 for two lemonades. I went back to him after I saw the charge and he said he accidentally selected the alcohol drink.

I refuse to buy food from them again.,2024-09-08,13:12
"Yup and I‚Äôve been charged the tip even when I don‚Äôt say/select it. I‚Äôm sorry but these prices are way too high to be asking for more. 

As much money as this place brings in they should be paying workers enough to not have to beg for tips. Anyone know what they make?",2024-09-08,13:21
Fuck these slime bags and tip culture. These folks aren‚Äôt making a server‚Äôs wage fuck their tips in general. Hope ppl wise up and call this shit out to the point of negative reviews on the ballpark as a whole.

The 410 stand behind section 83 is the only vendors i have been to that do not show you the tip screen and my 4.10 meals always seem to be 7$ charges,2024-09-09,18:49
You have to be insistent and ensure you get a good look at the charges. I bring dollars and ensure No Tip is selected and give a buck or two cash. They seem to appreciate the cash.,2024-09-09,23:52

"We got hit with the 25% for lemonade. Lemonade. And they are not hand squeezing these jokers. Or like smashing them with hammers. They‚Äôre running a compress machine and mixing water. 

I do not mind ripping and being more than generous but enough is enough. And yes, it was automatically added without knowing. Love the orioles but you may as well call this the Chris Davis tax. 

it‚Äôs not my job to pay your employees and extra 25% because you went and got Corbin Burnes this year. If you wouldn‚Äôt have picked up Trevor Rogers or Craig Kimberl then yes, I‚Äôd pay that 25%.",2024-09-10,20:31

"Vendor here. Recently the ballpark changed the default on all of the handheld devices for in seat vending. Mine is always set at 20%, that is not my choice, I personally think it's cringy setting a default. I often reset it to zero before handing it to people, but to be honest the whole process just slows everything down for everyone. Yes there are some scammy vendors, but generally most are honest people just trying to get by like everyone. Most of us are just working hard to give you the best experience possible. If you appreciate our hard work and the cold beverages that we provide, feel free to tip, or don't, that's your choice. Being asked to tip everywhere on everything is getting out of hand, even for us. Thank you all for your business, let's Go O's!",2024-09-20,21:55
"This is gonna be a long one but I highly recommend you guys read it and live by it. 

I've been a traveling beer hawker/vendor/in seat vendor for 10 years full time. I work large scale concerts and sporting events all over the country including Camdem.  Here's some points and advice for everyone when making purchases.

1 - Unfortunately the card reader does default to 25%, HOWEVER.... They should still be showing you the screen and saying ""There's an option to tip on here or you can tip in cash"" Not all card readers are set up like that, and there is a way to turn it off. 

2 - If you don't ever see the screen when making a purchase, That vendor 100% self tipped and you should tell them to take you to their vending com to tell the manager.  

3 - Self tipping is fraud.  Don't let them get away with it. 

4 - Something I do when selling beer, I always hold the reader facing the customer.  So from my angle the screen is upside down, I select the beers, customer either taps or inserts their card, tip screen pops up, and then I hand them their beer.  Doing it that way eliminates the feeling of customer thinking I'm doing something shady because the screen faced them the whole time.  

5 - if it says transaction failed or please insert card again, IT IS NOT DOUBLE CHARGING YOU...When this happens, I say this exact thing ""Just to be clear, Nothing has went through until you see the tip screen!"" 

6 - Some of us guys carrying the tubs around have traveled in from out of state and when cash was accepted we could at least know we were gonna leave that event with enough cash tips to cover our travel costs and maybe a meal or 2.  Now that it's cashless EVERYWHERE our tips and commission comes on a check. Some companies pay within 2 weeks.  But majority of them pay once every 30 days they are now taxing our tips. So please consider tipping with cash. 

7 - Beer guys(the guys carrying a tub), We work for a commission and our tips.  Commissions before cashless were anywhere from 12% to 18%.  These companies only knew what we made in commission because all of our tips were in cash. Now that our tips are on a card reader  they can see exactly what we made, and have started to drastically drop our commissions.  Now the average commission is 6% to 8% of your total sales. So once again CASH TIPS ARE APPRECIATED. 

8 - When you buy a beer from a person that's standing in front of what we call a ""Beer Portable""(a giant cooler on wheels) That person is not getting a commission, They are 99% of the time getting a flat rate of $75 to $150.  The reason their pay is low is because, Unlike us beer guys they don't have to go anywhere to get beer and that portable worker is literally depending on you to tip.  Instead of thinking, I'm not tipping because all they did was hand me a beer, INSTEAD.. Tip or don't tip baser on, Did that person even greet me? did they even make even contact? Did they ask me if I'm having a good time? etc.

9 - Last but not least, YES WE ARE SUPPOSED TO OPEN EVERY BEER...You have never gotten a cold beer served to you in a bar setting with the cap still on so its no different at the game or concert.  The reason being, 1 - Imagine every beer sold with a cap and that cap gets tossed on the ground and then if it's a festival then people walk all over them and push them into the ground etc.... IT'S A NIGHTMARE CLEAN UP.  But most importantly, Throwing a beer aluminum can or bottle that's hasn't been opened can do way more damage than a can or bottle that is opened and can't hold liquid.",2024-09-24,14:50
"Bring cash, and their dishonesty can work in your favor. I‚Äôve been allowed to walk away with more than $50 worth of beer and food by giving the kiosk watcher $20 cash.",2024-09-08,08:47
"I miss being able to use cash at the park. I could at least give myself a budget and then decide how much to spend on a given night. Now, I feel like I can just tap to pay and end up spending way more a night than I‚Äôm used to. It‚Äôs just so frustrating.",2024-09-07,20:50
"My understanding is they don‚Äôt even get the tips. Just ordered from a vendor in my seat and he selected 0 for me.

Edit: Just ordered a plain Lemonade and the watched as the guy selected 20%. I smashed that 0 with no regrets.",2024-09-07,17:19
I just got back from the game today and this wasn't my experience tbf. They all did turn the screen around with a pre selected 25% but I don't really feel like I'm being scammed?  I can simply choose another amount?,2024-09-07,21:17

"# Changes to Social Media Links in r/Orioles

After careful consideration and feedback from our community, r/Orioles will implement a new policy regarding social media links. **Effective immediately, we will no longer allow direct links to Twitter/X and other social media platforms requiring logins or redirecting users to external apps to view content.** This includes platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, and Snapchat.

We aim to maintain r/Orioles as an accessible, welcoming space focused on high-quality discussion. As social media landscapes shift, it‚Äôs clear that some platforms no longer align with these goals. These platforms have created challenges for many users, from growing concerns about hate speech and misinformation to issues with spam, intrusive ads, and data privacy. We want to prioritize your experience here by minimizing those impacts.

# Why This Change?

This change wasn‚Äôt a decision we made lightly. We listened to the community and considered three main points:

1. **Quality and accessibility**: Requiring logins to view basic content creates user barriers. Additionally, the rise in spam and inappropriate content on some platforms detracts from the value they once offered.
2. **Hate speech and harmful content**: We‚Äôve seen an increase in harmful rhetoric and want to ensure this subreddit stays a welcoming space for Orioles fans.
3. **Community feedback**: Many users shared frustrations about these platforms and their policies. We value your input and want to create an environment that reflects the values of this community.

# What About Screenshots?

We‚Äôve chosen not to allow screenshots of social media posts. Although users often share them in good faith, they create challenges, such as verifying authenticity and ensuring accessibility for users who rely on screen readers. Focusing on original discussion and other sources offers a better path forward.

# Where Do We Go From Here?

We‚Äôre not endorsing any specific alternatives, but there are many ways to stay informed. Orioles news and updates are available from MLB‚Äôs official channels, local sports reporters, and fan-driven spaces like this one. Let‚Äôs continue making r/Orioles a place for meaningful and informed discussions.

The moderators will review this policy after 30 days. We‚Äôll gather your feedback and adjust as needed to ensure the best experience for our community.

Thank you for being part of r/Orioles! If you have any questions or ideas, let us know.",2025-01-27,11:52
We welcome feedback but ask that you keep the conversation constructive and within subreddit guidelines. Please avoid excessive negativity to ensure a productive dialogue.,2025-01-27,12:44
Does this include paywalled sites (like Baltimore Sun)?,2025-01-27,11:59
"I fully understand links but no Screen shots seems a little much imo. 

Respectfully",2025-01-27,12:21
"So under this policy if Adley Rutschman himself posted on his official X/Twitter and instagram that he just signed an extension, the Orioles confirm it on their official X/twitter, and Jeff Passan tweets the deal out on X/twitter, none of that could be posted to this subreddit? 

We would instead have to wait for either 1) someone to post it to an approved site or 2) wait for an article to be written about it in a paper that does not require users to log in?

At that point, wont we just get posts where people say ‚ÄúI saw on Twitter Adley signed an extension?‚Äù",2025-01-27,15:25
It will be interesting to see what happens to engagement now that a huge chunk of news related to the team is apparently forbidden to share.,2025-01-27,12:19
"Concern (and I said this in the other thread) is that this is going to make sharing gameday news and clips extremely difficult. If a prospect does something in an MiLB game and the team posts the accomplishment on any of the usual social media channels (most sports teams are not on Bluesky), that would mean not being able to share it, if even screenshots are banned, being forced to find a way to download and post the video ourselves if it's a video, or waiting until the next day for someone's free blog to do the same. This seems like a shortsighted move.

At the very least there needs to be screenshots. If some news breaks but it's only up on social media, then if it's going to be posted here, it's going to be questioned, since there's no linkable source.",2025-01-27,22:06

Virtue signalling at its finest üëèüëè,2025-01-27,18:45
"This seems like it may be more problematic than beneficial because a substantial amount of news related to the MLB is disseminated through those platforms, often before it is shared elsewhere. That's not to say that there are not other problems that go along with it, but there are credible sources who use those platforms who may share breaking news that presumably could not be formally shared otherwise until they appear in a news article for a public-facing organization that does not require a login to view. Until that happens, do we say, ""hey I saw on XYZ that ABC""? or do we just not discuss it at all until it appears from another source?

If you allow those platforms, users here still have the option of choosing whether or not they want to engage with them. They have the option of outright ignoring and/or downvoting posts that use such platforms if they so desire. If those platforms are not allowed, it may create more of an information blackout than anything else.",2025-01-27,18:40

"So unless I‚Äôm missing something, essentially there‚Äôs not really a way to post news in real time now, right? Do we have to wait until a news article drops, which often times REQUIRES you to login to view like the Sun and Banner do?Regardless of your thoughts with banning X which many subs are doing for various reasons now, you included all the Meta socials leaving essentially reddit as the only mainstream one left? do we have to cross post to actually post news now?

I mean if I‚Äôm the minority than I am and excuse my ignorance but genuine question do people really click on links that often that a sweeping ban was necessary? I normally read the tweet or headline and move on. We are also banning screenshots to avoid any fake news and to try and maintain quality of reporting. Why not require all screenshots to have a link to the original post in the comments so those who choose to view can easily access while those who want to boycott certain sites can stay informed 

Genuine question but is anyone happy with this? Seems like a hardcore widespread knee jerk reaction and possibly worst policy I have seen across any subreddit in the last week.

"Hey Mr. Elias! Welcome to the family, we're happy to have you.

One thing that always struck me as frustrating is the Orioles pitching development - we draft strong arms, they struggle within the organization (or are undervalued) and then we trade them away and they flourish elsewhere (Arrieta, Davies, Hader, Miranda, and Bridwell come to mind). Any thoughts on this problem, what the culprit might be and how to remedy this issue going forward?",2018-11-19,13:22
"Welcome to Baltimore, Mike!

1. Whose idea was the AMA? This is a huge step forward in the name of transparency.
2. you mentioned Chris Davis in the presser... do you find that analytics can help someone that simply doesn't appear to be seeing the ball? Can never tell if it's mechanics causing these issues or mental.
3. as you are aware, the Orioles really missed out on the international market this year (i.e. victor victor, gaston, etc). Are there still plenty of, for lack of better word, cheaper options that the orioles can still take advantage of in this current period?
4. Pitching development...how do you plan to fix it?
5. Will you bring the pies back?",2018-11-19,13:21
"Hey Mike, thanks so much for doing this.  These small things show a commitment to forward thinking and transparency that we've wanted for a long time around here!

"Welcome to Baltimore, Mr. Elias.

From a front office standpoint, why are teams not as aggressive as they should be in taking the extra base, particularly home? The accepted stolen base target is around 78%, but when sending a runner home, it seems to be over 90%. Shouldn't teams want to be more aggressive, especially when it comes to run scoring opportunities?

Watched the press conference and was impressed with the direction you and John and Lou discussed.

"First, welcome to Baltimore! We're very happy to have you here.

What was the sales pitch like from John and Louis? What sold you on coming to Baltimore?

Being in a rebuilding mode, the Orioles are probably going to be drafting early for the next couple of years. You have experience drafting early with the Astros, and drafting well. What sort of players do you intend to go after in the draft and in international signings?

Does the coaching staff that was under Buck Showalter remain under contract, or will whoever you bring in have the freedom to hire their own guys? Also, I know you have *a lot* of people to hire, but I'd like you to talk a little about how you'll go about the managerial search, especially seeing as how the post-World Series musical chairs appear to have ended. What kind of manager is best for a squad in the place the Orioles are? Without naming names, are there people who (as Buck was) are on ESPN/MLBN/Fox who you think could manage again, and possibly could manage the Orioles?

While we know some things have to remain in confidence, how do you feel about the latitude given to you by ownership?

First and foremost: thank you. I honestly cannot recall a decision that has gotten this fanbase as unanimously excited as this one has. You've filled us with hope and while we know there is a long road ahead, we're behind you.

My questions:

1. Knowing the state of the organization, do you see the Orioles being active whatsoever in Free Agency?
2. 2019 will be the first time you've had the #1 draft pick since you took Correa/Appel/Aiken in 2012-14. Can you give us any thoughts about what you're going to do with the first overall pack in the 19 draft?
3. I imagine the analytics department will vastly expand. Are you taking resumes?

Best of luck in Baltimore.",2018-11-19,13:37
What is the best memory you have of going to a game at Camden Yards while growing up in the DMV?,2018-11-19,13:23
"Mr. Elias,

I have a few questions that you may or may not be able to answer:

Are you high on any guys in our farm system who may have been flying under the radar under our previous execs? 

 Buck Showalter gave an interview years ago where he talked about what he looked for in a player, which included things (if I remember correctly) such as strong gluts and ability to grow facial hair. Do you have any quirky ‚Äúbeyond the data‚Äù tactics of analyzing players? 

Do you think that relaxing the team policy of no or limited facial hair would bring more success? There are a lot of mustachioed guys playing some high quality ball right now. I always felt that Zach Britton would have been much more intimidating with a fu man chu. 

Thanks! Happy to have you in Baltimore!

"Welcome to Baltimore, Mike. Hopefully you can sense the excitement and anticipation you are bringing to town!

I have two questions, feel free to answer both, one, or none.

1. How do you balance team makeup during a rebuilding phase between bringing in old timer vets to mentor and help slog through tough seasons and promoting new talent to groom and give experience?
2. With 40-man rosters decisions due very soon, how have you been involved with protecting certain players from the rule 5?",2018-11-19,13:25
"Good morning, Mike, thank you for taking the time to do this.

Two questions -

First step in the door, what do you think is the most important  objective for this upcoming season?

Are you at liberty to discuss any potential coaching signings?

Again, thank you for taking the time. I know i dont just speak for myself, but here in Orioles land, we are all very excited about your hiring.",2018-11-19,13:21
"Hi Mike, thanks for being here and answering questions, that means a lot.

On one hand, O's fans have been frustrated in recent memory with the way young pitchers have been handled in the organization; for the most part that manifests from the track records of our pitching prospects at the major league level. We've seen quite a few pitchers drafted by the O's who have gone elsewhere and had greater success, and there is a feeling that this reflects poorly on the minor league staff to date.

On the other hand, there are other components to the player development puzzle, some of which can be handed down from the highest levels of the organization, some of which can be solved by scouting and selecting players with specific skillsets which fit into an overall philosophy.

My questions are: How much do you value continuity in the staff at the minor league level in the player development process? Do you anticipate making major changes there immediately, or do you envision taking a period to evaluate the current staff and/or gradually phasing those changes in to make the process more seamless for the players currently in the organization?",2018-11-19,13:47

Welcome to Baltimore and we in Orioles nation are glad to have you as our new GM and leading our rebuild!

1.  What does your plan entail about scouting domestically? Will we see a growth of scouts here in the United States and Canada for either the high school or lower college levels such as Division 2, division 3 or Community college ball; or a growth of the scouting department in general? 

2. How do you grade our farm system? I know it's mid tier, but are their pieces you find underrated or could use a different approach? 

3. Outside of things that are considered obvious areas of improvement (minor league system, international scouting, etc.) what do you think the Orioles should/are going to improve on the most? 

4. How has your day been so far? 

5. Will the Orioles be participating in the Rule 5 draft like in years past this year?

"Two questions Mike (and thanks for doing this)

1. The Orioles haven't had a pitching ace since Mike Mussina (aside from one year of Erik Bedard). Either we're the unluckiest team around in drafting pitching prospects (and luck certainly has played a part) or there's a fault in our pitching development. Considering many of our top prospects have dealt with injury issues and have complained (once elsewhere) that the Orioles messed with their mechanics, I wonder if there's something wrong. What are your plans to address this issue?

2. Do you plan to look more towards international spending than previous management did? We used to trade away international bonus pool money for a nice bag of baseballs, do you plan on focusing more on the international market?

Thanks again!",2018-11-19,13:53
"Hi, Mr. Elias. Congratulations on the job!

Playing in the AL East, it looks like the Red Sox and Yankees are going to be running the division for the immediate future, with the Rays maybe looking to be opportunistic for a wild card spot and the Jays bringing prospects (VLAD JR HYPE). 

With all that in mind, that do you think would be the timetable for making the Orioles competitive again? Do you think you're going to focus on the farm system and player development and hope that those players are ready whenever the other AL East teams are on their way down in five or so years? or do you think you're going to try to trade and/or sign players who are closer to ready to maybe compete in a year or two?

2. What's the plan for the analytics/scouting departments?  We basically have none right now to speak of so do you see it as an opportunity to build things as you see fit (think blank slate) or is it somewhat of a nightmare since you basically have to build it from the ground up?

Thank you for doing this AMA. As a long time Oriole fan, I am very excited to see what you and your team will do to build this organization back to its winning ways.

So for the past few years we have heard through reports that the Orioles front office has had too many chiefs and not enough Indians. We have no clue how true this is but the reports were that Dan didn't have full control over decisions. Example: Brady Anderson making decisions or Peter Angelo's wanting Davis so much we bid against ourselves to get him.

So my question is, do you have 100% control over the rebuild and the baseball decisions?

"Hello Mike,

I'm a bit late to the party, as many questions without replies have stacked up, but wish to pose a question about analytics with regard to a hitter's approach at the plate. 

From watching Oriole hitters recently, especially this past season, there seemed to be a take the first pitch approach with some, while others would be more aggressive (looking at Machado and Jones here even though they are with other teams) at the plate. 

My question becomes thus, would analytics dictate an aggressive approach to a pitcher with a high first pitch strike percentage, and conversely, taking a more cautious approach with a low first pitch strike percentage? Or does it depend on the number of pitches/type of pitches/frequency of use for each pitch that dictates a hitter's thinking at the plate?

I ask because much of the lineup appeared lost, especially with off-speed and breaking balls. Enough to where it became our Achilles's heel.",2018-11-21,01:16
"Hey Mr. Elias, huge Orioles fan, and now a huge fan of yours, I am a young fan (15) so I‚Äôm sort of new to the change of management for the Orioles but I must say, I am pleased how it‚Äôs turned out so far! So to my question, I read a book about the Cubs and when Theo Epstein took over and what he did to ‚Äúbreak the curse‚Äù in Chicago, one of the things was completely changing the outlook of how things are done. He wrote basically a rule book I believe and just rewrote the ‚Äúculture.‚Äù So my question is, is that how it‚Äôs going to be in Baltimore? A complete overhaul of everything? Or do you see some new ideas you like in Baltimore already? And also how much of the way things are done in Houston or St. Louis be shown in this rebuild in terms of structure?

1) where do you view the Orioles' farm system compared to the league and how do you plan to fill it with talent for the future?

"Welcome Mr. Elias!

I've been an Orioles fan as long as I can remember. I think my earliest memories go back to 1964 and I was fortunate to have my early fan years intersect some of the Orioles strongest seasons. I'm hoping for a new resurgence.

I've got some thoughts on alternatives to the traditional five-man rotation, ones that leverages many short stints by middle relievers instead of relying on long outings by ""starters.""  I've written up a brief summery. It's called ""The Nine-man Rotation."" It's only a few pages, but I believe it effectively covers the concept.  I'd be honored if you would have the time to read it.

Thanks for doing this and welcome to Birdland!  

&amp;#x200B;

\- Your approach seems to be based on the level of risk associated with a pick, a signing, etc.

  \- In the example of a high school pitcher being a #1 draft pick, I would assume you look at it being a higher risk than a college pitcher simply because there are more variables involved in them being successful.

For every Carlos Correa, there is a Mark Appel (if this is too soon, my apologies.)

I think the fan base rightfully has the expectation that we‚Äôre not going to be a contender this year. With that being said, are there any specific types of players that you‚Äôll be targeting via free agency or trade this offseason to help the near-term competitiveness? i.e. inning-eating 4th/5th starter type, bullpen arms with years of team control that could become trade-able assets, a defensive specialist shortstop/platoon outfielder, etc. ",2018-11-19,13:32
"As Baltimore is in the middle of the rebuild phrase, player development will be key to building a future successful franchise. As when you were with Houston, using a various of analytic tools was a helpful part in the rebuild process to include Blast Motion, Rapsado, HitTrax, and Edgertronic cameras. Will you be implementing these tools into Baltimore's Player Development as a part of the rebuild process? Will Baltimore now be known as one of more ""Analytical"" franchises, as opposed to the past few years?",2018-11-19,13:25
"Hi Mike, great to have you onboard!

Clearly (and this is something fans/pundits have been discussing for quite awhile) the Orioles have historically rejected key areas of modern team building, like analytics and international talent acquisition.

What foundations do we have to build on re: international talent, and what steps do we need to take to elevate our international pipeline to another level long-term? Do you see international talent as a sort of equalizer for a small market team like ours?
",2018-11-19,13:49
"Hello.

I know it isn't easy to get to specific when trying to predict the future, so instead do you have goals or plans that you'd be willing to share for 1 month down the road? 1 year? 3 years? etc?

2nd question: the Orioles made a lot of moves this past trade deadline to get many middle-of-the-road prospects as well as a lot of international signing money. What is your plan moving forward with what has already been laid down from Duquette's rebuild start?",2018-11-19,13:27
"Mike,

Welcome to Baltimore. I am ecstatic about your hire and look forward to your Plan.

What is your first order of business after all members of your team/Front office, field manager are in place?. Where do u begin?

As a former pitcher How Hard did you throw at your Highest level?

Do You need any additional Domestic scouts for the Baltimore / Maryland area?

There is alot of good talent in this area, as a local travel Tournament team coach for 16u.. ",2018-11-19,13:43
"Thanks for coming!

As a new GM on a rebuilding team, does the team give you a time frame in which they expect to be competitive? Do they say something like ""by x years we expect to be competing for the division""? If so, do you think that would cause you to take greater risks as that time approached? 

I'll certainly understand if especially that second question can't be answered, but it's something I've always wondered. ",2018-11-19,14:04
"Mike, 

One more question. I think we were all a bit disappointed that the team put all their eggs in the international basket (and came away empty) last season. How do you plan on rebuilding the farm system when most of our tradeable assets have already been moved? Primarily through the draft or are there still other avenues you can explore? Also, what is your tentative timetable for the rebuild? Thanks for your answer!",2018-11-19,14:01
"Welcome to Baltimore, Mike...we're excited to have you!

1) How are you building out your analytics team? There are many great data nerds in Baltimore that work in advertising/marketing tech and business intelligence that would love working for you

&amp;#x200B;

2) Do you really have free reign? This would signal a fundamental shift for us fans...

&amp;#x200B;

3) When does Bill Ripken start as the new Manager?",2018-11-19,14:06
"Hey Mike, I am thrilled that you are going to be our GM and wish you nothing by success!

A couple of former O's talked about how different the approach was with other teams in terms of the use of analytics, and pitchers always seemed to have more success elsewhere.

How much do you think an expanded analytical approach could improve Orioles pitching already at the Major League level?",2018-11-19,13:35
"First of all, welcome to Baltimore and I couldn't be more excited about your hiring.  Seems like ownership took their time and really did their due diligence in taking the organization in a new direction.  What do you think about coming into the AL East and competing with two perrenial powerhouses in the Yankees and Red Sox with two of the highest payrolls in the league?",2018-11-19,14:12
"Mike, 

Welcome to Baltimore! Excited to have you on board. It seems like, in the past, there has been some real confusion about roles and responsibilities of some employees within the organization. Do you plan on better defining those roles and being more transparent with the fans about what they are? Thanks in advance for your answer. ",2018-11-19,13:57
"Welcome Mike

The orioles haven‚Äôt had an ace in a long long time. Someone that can start and give you a QS 70% of the time. It‚Äôs proven that a 2 strong man rotation can take you to the playoffs.

",2018-11-19,13:52
"Hi Mike, Welcome to Baltimore.

&amp;#x200B;

The Orioles analytics department, especially with recent departures, is very much a blank slate.

Do you have an overarching philosophy when it comes to how you want this team to be built?  I'm sure there's many parts to it, but what are the key points we should be looking at 2 or 3 years down the road as fans to see that your plan is working.

Also, Blue Crabs or King Crab Legs?",2018-11-19,13:42
"Welcome to Baltimore. Thanks for taking the time to answer for us. Will the Orioles spend the bulk of the International Money Space that they are allocated for this signing period? Will you be the conduit for information going forward or will the ownership group expand their visibility? Again, happy you are here. ",2018-11-19,13:59
"Hi Mike, excited to have you aboard. Hoping to see some Orioles Magic back in the yard soon. My question is what is the plan in terms of balancing trying out young talent and having some proven vets to provide leadership along the way? It can be tough in a clubhouse with no one to set the bar, so to say. ",2018-11-19,14:51
"Mike, welcome to Baltimore!

You have mentioned the importance of the seamless integration of a team‚Äôs analytics, scouting, and player development. Do you think that‚Äôs something you‚Äôll be able to get current staff to buy into? Or is there a need for wholesale personnel change in scouting and player devo?",2018-11-19,13:36
"Mike, 

It's great to have you on board! Are there any specific positions you anticipate trying to fill via free agency this off season? Or will the focus be more on saving money, working with what we have, and giving some of our younger players a chance to gain valuable experience at the MLB level? ",2018-11-19,14:33
"I never expected this. 

Mike, considering the Orioles payroll and the fact that analytics isn't the advantage to small market teams that it used to be.  How do you plan to compete with Boston and NY considering their payrolls and analytics expenditures (Boston not so much as far as analytics). ",2018-11-19,14:36
"Welcome to Birdland, Mike! Your hiring has been amazing news, and I‚Äôm thrilled to have you on board.  

How much of your approach to building the team take into account ballpark factors? Such as favoring pitchers with high GB rates.

PS - any chance that you went to Greenbrier West or Frost?",2018-11-19,14:53
"1. When you analyze a veteran pitcher, what statistics do you value most?

2. Do you feel the ""win"" as a pitcher stat is a good indicator of a quality starter? (Both deGrom, and Giolito had 10 wins in 32 starts this season) 

3. Do you believe in allowing a pitcher to develop a cutter?",2018-11-19,13:54
Do you plan on putting an emphasis on building a Latino-friendly culture throughout the organization? The game has become multi-cultural and having a level of familiarity for International prospects seems to be a major selling point for young kids coming from Latin America. ,2018-11-19,15:16
"Hi Mike! Congrats on your hire and welcome to Baltimore. 

Obviously, you've had some success in Houston despite a smaller payroll compared to some of the big ballcubs (although it has creeped up). What lessons from the Astros rise are you hoping to apply to Baltimore? ",2018-11-19,14:48
"Hey Mike,

How will the total annual payroll for the team be determined? Do you have full autonomy to spend as much money as you want, or will John and Lou give you a budget to work with and will you be able to go outside that if necessary on your own?",2018-11-19,13:46

"Do people not talk about the constant rumors of steroid use attached to Davis out of politeness?  From me on the outside not following his career until the hitless streak, his rise and fall looks just like any other PED user who signs a gigantic guaranteed contract and no longer needs to juice.

All this talk about ""fixing his swing"" is meaningless if what we are seeing simply IS Chris Davis, minus all the steroid fed beef.  The Orioles organization would be doing no one any favors if they keep trotting him out there hoping he would ""rediscover"" something he never actually had without a drug he no longer needs to use.

"I‚Äôm Brandon Hyde, new Orioles manager AMA

I hail from Santa Rosa, California. I graduated from Long Beach State University (CA) and then spent four seasons as a player in the White Sox system before beginning my coaching career. I‚Äôve spent 16 professional seasons in various coaching positions, including as the Chicago Cubs director of player development. Most recently, I served as the bench coach for the Cubs. I was a part of the team who helped bring winning baseball back to Chicago, including a World Series title in 2016.

I‚Äôm proud to be the 20th manager in Orioles history and I‚Äôm excited to get to work. I look forward to reading your questions.

Ask me anything!

"Welcome to Charm City! Very excited to have you in Birdland. 

I think Os fans understand that we are in the early stages of a rebuild and that going from the worst record in baseball to playing in October doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. With that being the case, how are you going to define success in your first season? Obviously every team wants to go to the playoffs every year, but for a team just starting from the ground up, what do you want to see a year from now as evidence that we‚Äôre on the right track?",2018-12-17,22:29
"I sure do love the lead time! Here ~~is my TED Talk~~ are my questions. 

Tell us what sold you on the opportunity to come to Baltimore? What did Mike Elias tell you, what did the Angelos brothers tell you, what did you see in this team and its potential that made you want to get in on the ground floor?

I imagine you‚Äôre still in the process of making calls and booking flights, but the Orioles are a team depleted of lots of veterans, lots of talent, from Hardy to Machado to Gausman to Jones. While the Orioles have no realistic shot at a pennant next year, leadership is key to developing the talent to get it some years from now. Is there somebody on the roster who you see as being The Guy (whether you‚Äôre ready to name him or not) and/or is there somebody you and Elias might sign or trade for to be The Guy?

Before putting pen to paper, did you seek counsel from Joe Maddon or any of your peers across the league? While I understand some conversations between friends you‚Äôll want to remain between friends, what was a bit of advice you got from somebody that stuck out to you?

The Orioles of 2019 are very much a blank slate, but they‚Äôre a franchise with a rich past, one commemorated in bronze, etched into the pavement and personified in Brooks Robinson, who you got to meet Monday. While I don‚Äôt expect you to be able to name everybody who put on the uniform or commiserate over the annus horribilis of 2005, tell us about something either from over the course of your career outside the organization or your several days inside it that struck you about the history of baseball in Baltimore. On a personal note, I‚Äôd recommend you take a stroll a few blocks off to the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum.",2018-12-18,00:24

"Hey Brandon, welcome to Birdland and thanks for taking the time to answer questions.

 In the press conference, you alluded to the fact that you'll be  collaborating with Mike Elias and the rest of the front office. Does that mean you'll be intimately involved in personnel decisions. If so, what is the general plan in free agency at this point in the process? What are some areas of need you anticipate going after?

Also, is your daughter named Arya, as in Arya Stark? I'm not sure if I heard it correctly. 

I wish you a long and successful tenure here in Baltimore. Go O's!",2018-12-17,23:33

We as fans aren't really used to this kind of interaction from the team so this is very much appreciated. I was wondering how you go about learning about learning about the Orioles organization.

"Hey, I am a younger baseball fan (15) and I have always been drawn to the management side of the game. I really admire that you worked your way up in the different organizations and in the baseball industry. I was wondering were you always drawn to managing and coaching or was it after you played minor league ball? And also, how did you end up with your first job in baseball management? Were you a good candidate because you played for a few years or what? 

Also I go to Greensboro Grasshoppers games fairly often and I believe the first game I went to was in 2006, if only I had known their manager then, was going to be the manager of my favorite team now lol.

Thanks, Ryan.",2018-12-18,11:36

"Hi Brandon. Thank you for doing this. Really looking forward to seeing how you can right this ship. I'm especially invested because a few of my friends are playing in the O's system and I hope that they can be a big  part of your team in a couple years.

Anyway, here's my question:

Who do you feel has the chance to really break out on this team, be it a prospect or current member of the roster and make a huge difference in improving the O's win total?


",2018-12-18,10:56
"Hi Brandon! Can‚Äôt wait for the new Elias-Hyde era to begin. Wishing you best of luck.

You saw it first hand, what did the Cubs do with Arrietta that we didn‚Äôt do? The same can be said for other pitchers. But was this an organizational fault by the Orioles? Brilliance by the Cubs? Random luck?... and if it‚Äôs an organizational fault, do you think Elias and your staff will be able to produce a true homegrown ace for the first time in a long time?",2018-12-18,11:02
"What are you going to do coming into a clubhouse that might still be a little biased towards Buck?

Welcome!  How would you describe your coaching style? ,2018-12-17,22:00
"I'm really looking forward to seeing your managing style as you work with our team. 

I have 2 questions:

1. When working with young players, the previous leadership was criticized for trying to teach players away from their instincts, especially pitchers. We've heard Jake Arrieta criticize the organization, Dylan Bundy talk about the organization not wanting him to throw a cutter. What is your philosophy regarding players and their natural tendencies?

2. Speaking to that, the previous leadership embraced a philosophy of high home run numbers, high strikeouts and incredibly low walk totals. How will you as manager work to increase the Orioles OBP, and encourage more plate discipline and patience overall?",2018-12-18,00:30

To get to it, my question is what are your personal first steps as manager for our club? What is your priority list. What do you expect to be the biggest challenges here? 

Finally, I like small ball, how do you feel about focusing on keeping the ball in the park and being aggressive on base. We haven't had big base stealers since Roberts and Patterson.

Thank for taking the time to read my question and hopefully answer it! Can't wait for the season to start, I haven't been this excited in years for what the Orioles are doing.",2018-12-17,23:13

"Good morning, and welcome to Baltimore! It's a pleasure to have you here, and I'm sure you'll do a phenomenal job with the team.

The use of Sabermetrics/Analytical observations within organizations seems to be a contentious issue within the sport for a lot of fans, how do you intend to balance the usage of modern tactics (Opener, more aggressive usage of shifts) with traditional focus on player development? How did your experience working with Joe in Chicago impact your views on managing? 

Thank you so much for your time!",2018-12-18,10:44
"Hi Brandon!!!!! First of all welcome to Baltimore!!!!! All this buzz is getting me  excited for Orioles baseball again next year! What are some managerial aspects that you bring to the table that we might not have seen just yet? Also, is this a new approach that the O's are taking to better connect with the fans.

Good luck in 2019 and can't wait to see you run down the orange carpet on Opening Day!!!!!",2018-12-17,21:56
"I think its cool that we now get this direct avenue to a professional sports organization manager. It stinks going into such a tough situation, yet the only direction to go is up. Do you think coaches/managers in pro sports (i guess there‚Äôs more leeway in baseball) should get more benefit of the doubt when they inherit a team with poor/doubtful prospects? Like in football its one year/even half a year or youre out. Even though the team itself (though they‚Äôll never say it of course) just stinks?",2018-12-18,10:50

When you look towards the 2019 season, what do you want to see from the young roster?

What kind of timeline, realistically, could fans expect before we start seeing the transition from full rebuild to real on-field success, +/- 5 years?",2018-12-18,07:52
"Welcome, Brandon! Happy to have you!

You spent quite a while under Joe Maddon who is seen as a bit of an ""outside the box"" thinker. Further, Mike Elias has spoken at length about the implementation of analytics across the organization. Do you see yourself as someone who is open to incorporating analytics in your approach to roster management, coaching, lineup construction, etc? What ways might we see this in your approach to managing?",2018-12-18,09:29

That's great, and I think it goes a long way towards getting fan engagement, but I'm wondering where the direction is coming from?

Until the end of April?  Until the All-Star break?

Obviously you don't want to pull the plug too soon as a player may figure things out eventually (like Kendrys Morales did for the Blue Jays this season), but there has to be a point where you have to make the tough decision.",2018-12-18,10:33

Working with Joe Maddon and experiencing that kind of success with the Cubs must've been great.

What are your thoughts on the importance of a veteran player‚Äôs leadership in a clubhouse going through a rebuild? 

What is your top priority going into the 2019 season? 



",2018-12-17,23:01
"Welcome to Baltimore, Brandon! We‚Äôre all excited for you to join our Birdland family. Only one question, the same I asked Mike when he did an AMA with us. In your eyes, what can we do as fans to help this organization grow and succeed?",2018-12-18,09:36
"Hi Brandon! Welcome to Baltimore! What is the #1 quality you look for in a player? What type of team do you want to build? Besides a winning one.

Looking forward to your response and excited to see what you bring to Baltimore!",2018-12-18,08:49
"Are you at liberty to explain the interview process? This has always interested me. How does it begin? What kinds of questions do they ask? How long did it take you for them to tell you you got the job?

Thanks for being here!",2018-12-18,10:41
"Many of our current/former players took a big role in community outreach (Machado, Jones, Showalter). Do you have any plans to launch such an initiative?

I look forward to your tenure and can't wait to attend games in 2019.",2018-12-18,11:33
Do you plan on increasing international scouting? As it's obvious the many teams that have benefit from it heavily while the Orioles have been slow to scout in South America and Asia and have struggled to find young talent.,2018-12-18,11:05
"Congratulations on the job! We're definitely gonna miss you in Chicago, but it's always a proud moment to see someone moving up in the world. My question is, what are you most looking forward to about working in Baltimore?",2018-12-18,10:34
Happy to have you in Baltimore,2018-12-17,22:31
"Hi, coach. Were you aware that your name is an anagram for ""bone dry hand"" (among some others that aren't exactly safe for work)? Anyway, let me know if you'd like me to recommend a good hand lotion. Good luck this year!",2018-12-18,09:59
"Welcome to Baltimore, Mr. Hyde! I think I speak for everyone here when I say we‚Äôre really excited to have you here. 

Given your background in player development, which of our prospects intrigues you the most and why? ",2018-12-17,23:36
Welcome to Birdland! I dig the facial hair - will you be keeping it during the regular season and does this mean that the O‚Äôs facial hair policy (that may or may not exist) will be more relaxed in 2019? I hope so!!,2018-12-17,22:34
"Welcome, and Go O‚Äôs!

Looking at the rotation going into 2019, what do you think the biggest challenges will be, and will you consider some unconventional tactics such as an ‚Äúopener‚Äù in order to manage it? ",2018-12-17,21:54
"For the last few years the Orioles' batters have typified the current league-wide high-strikeout high-homerun trend. Is this a strategy you believe in, or do you hope to encourage a more balanced lineup?",2018-12-18,09:08
"Ok, so let's say you had one and only one pitcher.  You won the world series with that pitcher but since then he's around 40-40 with a 5.2 ERA.

You drafted a backup pitcher and he's coming up in the farm system.  He has an ERA of 8 but throws 22 strikeouts a game.  And he throws underhand.

Do you keep the old pitcher or try out this new guy?",2018-12-17,23:27
"Welcome to Baltimore, I‚Äôm so excited for the future of the Orioles! 
As a young team what type of culture do you plan on instilling here and what are the challenges in creating that ideal culture?",2018-12-17,23:22
"I'm excited to see what you can do (as a Pirates fan who follows the O's a bit) 

I am sure there aren't much in the way of expectations... but what are your expectations for yourself in 2019?",2018-12-18,10:52
"Congratulations on the hiring and welcome to Birdland.

What is an aspect of the Cubs organization that you would like to implement with the Orioles in order to be more successful?",2018-12-17,22:28
"Brandon what‚Äôs your opinion on some teams switching to a reliever focused roatation where the relief pitchers start a game? Is this something you could see yourself doing? 

",2018-12-18,10:22
"First of all Mr. Hyde, welcome to Baltimore!

How will you measure success for the O's this season? In other words, what has to happen this season for it to be a good year?",2018-12-17,22:38
"Say hypothetically you're in a one game WC playoff where if you lose your season ends, and say you're in a tie game extra innings. Which pitcher do you use:

1) Your closer, who is coming off a historically excellent season.

2) Your failed starter, who's been among the worst pitchers in baseball over the last few years.

",2018-12-18,11:27
"What would be your opinion of bringing DJ LeMahieu in to play 2nd? As a Rockies fan growing up in an orioles household, I think he would be a great fit for the team!",2018-12-18,11:49
The orioles are perpetual locked into a three way tie as AL East members (much like my jyas) what if anything can be done to economically battle the Sox's and yanks?,2018-12-18,12:05
"Brandon, any chance I could get an autograph for my kiddo for (looks at the calendar)   Orthodox Christmas?


good luck from a Pirates fan.",2018-12-18,10:23

"Wow, you‚Äôre a manager! Congratulations. Now, the question every manager is being asked: what are your thoughts on banning The Shift?",2018-12-18,10:35
"Hi Brandon, congrats on being the new manager. I know baseball is a big time consumer, but are there any video games you play?",2018-12-18,10:29
"Going forward, how do you anticipate your background in player development will impact your contribution to the rebuild? ",2018-12-18,01:40
"I hope you enjoy your stay in Baltimore! Now, as of right now, how do you feel about the current state of the O's?",2018-12-18,11:09
Let's Go O's!!!,2018-12-18,15:17
"Hey Brandon, 

Who is the funniest / most entertaining player that you coached? Any great stories to share? ",2018-12-18,10:41
"Hi Brandon, it's Earl from Frederick. Why don't you and the Orioles go out and get some more team speed?",2018-12-18,11:21
What do you think was the key or combining factors that led to the O's having such a terrible season? ,2018-12-18,10:55
"After a long, hard day at the park, do you like to come home and watch an episode of The Wire or Roc?",2018-12-18,00:26
Hi Brandon! The O's of the past few years have been based around power hitting. Are there any plans to use advanced metrics to change this for the future to more of a small-ball look? ,2018-12-17,21:59

"So random thought....why do they have champagne and all that shit in the locker room after making a 1 game play in wild card game? Before they put the wild card game in, if two teams were tied at the end of the year they'd go to a 1 game play in match. Those teams wouldn't celebrate like this because it could end in 1 game. Why do they have the extravagant celebration just for extending your season 1 game. I could see it after the WC game.",2016-10-03,11:24

"I am in Nafplion, Greece.  I see a man with an Orioles hat.  I am from Baltimore am wearing Ravens gear and have not missed an opening day since the early 90s.  My dad would pull me out of school to go to Camden Yards.

I said hey to a stranger with a familiar hat and asked him if he was from Baltimore, and he said no, but his son plays for the Orioles.  It was Ryan O'Hearn's parents and his godfather!!  They could not have been nicer, and it was an awesome encounter halfway around the world!  I'm not sure if they want pictures posted, but I got a photo with his dad and his godfather talked smack about Yankee Stadium, and it was the taste of home that has left me smiling all day.

I told them how I've been to 2131, Eddie Murray's 500 home run game, the Delmon Double game, and have been in Baltimore my whole life and have never been more excited to be an O's fan.  They told me Ryan loves playing in Baltimore, and I told them we love having him.  

Great people, great life, great big wide world we live in.  

Go O's",2024-09-08,14:15

"Ryan is one of my favorite players to watch. He‚Äôs thankful to be where he is, he earned his opportunities through hard work on his craft, and boy can he got the baseball hard. The Baltimore Orioles are not just more versatile and talented because of him, they also have more hunger to win because of him. Three Cheers for Ryan O‚ÄôHearn!",2024-09-12,12:02
