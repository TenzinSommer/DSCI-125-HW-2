Aside from my Garceau rant, this was an incredible start and one wild pitch away from a Perfect Game. These things haven’t happened with the Orioles since ‘95 and Ripken or ‘14 and the Young double. This is what keeps me hooked year after year with the Orioles. I know we are in a rebuild, but to see a start like that and get taken back to my 90’s teams with Mussina dominating, I love it. I hope we don’t go the Bedard route and trade him. He seems like a front of the rotation guy for years to come and he’s not headed to free agency.

"Hey Mr. Elias! Welcome to the family, we're happy to have you.

One thing that always struck me as frustrating is the Orioles pitching development - we draft strong arms, they struggle within the organization (or are undervalued) and then we trade them away and they flourish elsewhere (Arrieta, Davies, Hader, Miranda, and Bridwell come to mind). Any thoughts on this problem, what the culprit might be and how to remedy this issue going forward?",2018-11-19,13:22,
"Welcome to Baltimore, Mike!

1. Whose idea was the AMA? This is a huge step forward in the name of transparency.
2. you mentioned Chris Davis in the presser... do you find that analytics can help someone that simply doesn't appear to be seeing the ball? Can never tell if it's mechanics causing these issues or mental.
3. as you are aware, the Orioles really missed out on the international market this year (i.e. victor victor, gaston, etc). Are there still plenty of, for lack of better word, cheaper options that the orioles can still take advantage of in this current period?
4. Pitching development...how do you plan to fix it?
5. Will you bring the pies back?",2018-11-19,13:21,
"Hey Mike, thanks so much for doing this.  These small things show a commitment to forward thinking and transparency that we've wanted for a long time around here!  I know you didn't mention the length of the contract, can you confirm if there is a specific length to the contract and that it is for a long enough period of time to see a real change happen from bottom up?  Thanks!",2018-11-19,13:18,

Wow I cant believe that we are seeing an AMA from the O's GM. I am so happy to see this level of fan engagement from out front office. I dont really have a question for you but just wanted to say welcome to Baltimore and we are excited to see what you can do!,2018-11-19,14:00,
"Welcome to Baltimore, Mr. Elias.

From a front office standpoint, why are teams not as aggressive as they should be in taking the extra base, particularly home? The accepted stolen base target is around 78%, but when sending a runner home, it seems to be over 90%. Shouldn't teams want to be more aggressive, especially when it comes to run scoring opportunities?

Any insight is appreciated.",2018-11-19,13:39,
"Hello Mr. Elias, it's pretty cool to potentially talk to a GM.  First question, what would you say is the least-understood part about baseball (and talent acquisition in it) today?

"Welcome back to Baltimore!

Watched the press conference and was impressed with the direction you and John and Lou discussed. Every baseball fan in Baltimore is familiar with the great Earl Weavers strategy of pitching, defense and the 3 run homer. Recently it seems our general strategy has basically been power above all else. What, if any, general on field strategy do you see Baltimore employing for this rebuild? Is this something that is dictated by what is available or do you believe you build that strategy from the ground up? Not saying I don’t love the 3 run homer but I’d love to see a little more small ball, speed and defense. Thanks!",2018-11-19,14:25,
"Besides the fat new paycheck, what attracted you to come work for the Orioles? Is it the challenge of rebuilding that made you want to come to the Orioles over some other clubs/staying with the Astros?

Also, as a kid growing up in Northern Virginia pre-Nats, were you at all an Orioles fan?

Thanks and I think it goes without saying we are all extremely excited you are here in Birdland",2018-11-19,13:19,
"First, welcome to Baltimore! We're very happy to have you here.

What was the sales pitch like from John and Louis? What sold you on coming to Baltimore?

Being in a rebuilding mode, the Orioles are probably going to be drafting early for the next couple of years. You have experience drafting early with the Astros, and drafting well. What sort of players do you intend to go after in the draft and in international signings?

Does the coaching staff that was under Buck Showalter remain under contract, or will whoever you bring in have the freedom to hire their own guys? Also, I know you have *a lot* of people to hire, but I'd like you to talk a little about how you'll go about the managerial search, especially seeing as how the post-World Series musical chairs appear to have ended. What kind of manager is best for a squad in the place the Orioles are? Without naming names, are there people who (as Buck was) are on ESPN/MLBN/Fox who you think could manage again, and possibly could manage the Orioles?

While we know some things have to remain in confidence, how do you feel about the latitude given to you by ownership?

Which would you rather fight: one horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?",2018-11-19,13:39,
No question but please make me proud to be an O's fan again ,2018-11-19,13:17,
"Congrats on the new job and am excited for the future!! 

Do you think because of Camden yards known “hitters” ball park status, you will be able to bring in a free agent or two ace pitcher or will you rely on your analytical system to grow arms in house? 
If you do rely in house, will you implement any new changes?

As an Os fan, it’s frustrating watching pitchers not develop here only to move on and become better elsewhere. Happens to often for it to be chance. ",2018-11-19,13:17,
"Mike- welcome to Birdland! Happy to have ya. 

Q- What are your plans with Chris Davis and that large contract? I find it difficult to believe he’s trade-able after his performance last year. ",2018-11-19,13:22,
"Hi Mike, welcome (back) to birdland. I personally am very excited for the future of Orioles baseball. 

1) Is a hot dog a sandwich?

2) Of the International countries, which one is most intriguing to the team in terms of player talent? 

3) Which do you like more, bWAR or fWAR?",2018-11-19,13:19,
"Mr. Elias,

First and foremost: thank you. I honestly cannot recall a decision that has gotten this fanbase as unanimously excited as this one has. You've filled us with hope and while we know there is a long road ahead, we're behind you.

My questions:

1. Knowing the state of the organization, do you see the Orioles being active whatsoever in Free Agency?
2. 2019 will be the first time you've had the #1 draft pick since you took Correa/Appel/Aiken in 2012-14. Can you give us any thoughts about what you're going to do with the first overall pack in the 19 draft?
3. I imagine the analytics department will vastly expand. Are you taking resumes?

Best of luck in Baltimore.",2018-11-19,13:37,
What is the best memory you have of going to a game at Camden Yards while growing up in the DMV?,2018-11-19,13:23,
"Mr. Elias,

I have a few questions that you may or may not be able to answer:

Are you high on any guys in our farm system who may have been flying under the radar under our previous execs? 

 Buck Showalter gave an interview years ago where he talked about what he looked for in a player, which included things (if I remember correctly) such as strong gluts and ability to grow facial hair. Do you have any quirky “beyond the data” tactics of analyzing players? 

Do you think that relaxing the team policy of no or limited facial hair would bring more success? There are a lot of mustachioed guys playing some high quality ball right now. I always felt that Zach Britton would have been much more intimidating with a fu man chu. 

Thanks! Happy to have you in Baltimore! 
",2018-11-19,13:27,
Welcome to the Orioles! I realize there are many specifics you can't comment on so I'll ask a broader question. Do you think the Orioles can and will provide you  with the resources and autonomy to be as successful as you were in St Louis and Houston?,2018-11-19,13:26,
"Welcome to Baltimore, Mike. Hopefully you can sense the excitement and anticipation you are bringing to town!

I have two questions, feel free to answer both, one, or none.

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do you balance team makeup during a rebuilding phase between bringing in old timer vets to mentor and help slog through tough seasons and promoting new talent to groom and give experience?
2. With 40-man rosters decisions due very soon, how have you been involved with protecting certain players from the rule 5?",2018-11-19,13:25,
"Good morning, Mike, thank you for taking the time to do this.

Two questions -

First step in the door, what do you think is the most important  objective for this upcoming season?

Are you at liberty to discuss any potential coaching signings?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, thank you for taking the time. I know i dont just speak for myself, but here in Orioles land, we are all very excited about your hiring.",2018-11-19,13:21,
"Hi Mike, thanks for being here and answering questions, that means a lot.

On one hand, O's fans have been frustrated in recent memory with the way young pitchers have been handled in the organization; for the most part that manifests from the track records of our pitching prospects at the major league level. We've seen quite a few pitchers drafted by the O's who have gone elsewhere and had greater success, and there is a feeling that this reflects poorly on the minor league staff to date.

On the other hand, there are other components to the player development puzzle, some of which can be handed down from the highest levels of the organization, some of which can be solved by scouting and selecting players with specific skillsets which fit into an overall philosophy.

My questions are: How much do you value continuity in the staff at the minor league level in the player development process? Do you anticipate making major changes there immediately, or do you envision taking a period to evaluate the current staff and/or gradually phasing those changes in to make the process more seamless for the players currently in the organization?",2018-11-19,13:47,
"Hi Mr. Elias. No question, just a big thanks for this AMA. I hope as fans we'll be able to continue to be in contact with you throughout this rebuilding process. 

Go O's! ",2018-11-19,13:39,
"Welcome to Birdland! We're so excited to have you. 

Will there be plans for further roster deconstruction at the major league level, or do you believe that what was done at the trade deadline this past July was sufficient? And do you believe that there is any chance of a current player to be signed to an extension?

&amp;#x200B;

Welcome to Baltimore and we in Orioles nation are glad to have you as our new GM and leading our rebuild! 

&amp;#x200B;

1.  What does your plan entail about scouting domestically? Will we see a growth of scouts here in the United States and Canada for either the high school or lower college levels such as Division 2, division 3 or Community college ball; or a growth of the scouting department in general? 

2. How do you grade our farm system? I know it's mid tier, but are their pieces you find underrated or could use a different approach? 

3. Outside of things that are considered obvious areas of improvement (minor league system, international scouting, etc.) what do you think the Orioles should/are going to improve on the most? 

4. How has your day been so far? 

5. Will the Orioles be participating in the Rule 5 draft like in years past this year?

"Two questions Mike (and thanks for doing this)

1. The Orioles haven't had a pitching ace since Mike Mussina (aside from one year of Erik Bedard). Either we're the unluckiest team around in drafting pitching prospects (and luck certainly has played a part) or there's a fault in our pitching development. Considering many of our top prospects have dealt with injury issues and have complained (once elsewhere) that the Orioles messed with their mechanics, I wonder if there's something wrong. What are your plans to address this issue?

2. Do you plan to look more towards international spending than previous management did? We used to trade away international bonus pool money for a nice bag of baseballs, do you plan on focusing more on the international market?

Thanks again!",2018-11-19,13:53,
"Hi, Mr. Elias. Congratulations on the job!

Playing in the AL East, it looks like the Red Sox and Yankees are going to be running the division for the immediate future, with the Rays maybe looking to be opportunistic for a wild card spot and the Jays bringing prospects (VLAD JR HYPE). 

With all that in mind, that do you think would be the timetable for making the Orioles competitive again? Do you think you're going to focus on the farm system and player development and hope that those players are ready whenever the other AL East teams are on their way down in five or so years? or do you think you're going to try to trade and/or sign players who are closer to ready to maybe compete in a year or two?

Thank you for you time, this is awesome!",2018-11-19,14:12,
"Welcome to Baltimore!  The FO announcing they were bringing you on board has given life back to this ballclub after the embarrassing season we just had.

1. From what's been said it sounds like the FO is basically giving you free reign as to how you want things to operate.  Do you have a plan already as far as who/what you want to bring to the Orioles or is this something that you'll kind of shape as time goes on?

2. What's the plan for the analytics/scouting departments?  We basically have none right now to speak of so do you see it as an opportunity to build things as you see fit (think blank slate) or is it somewhat of a nightmare since you basically have to build it from the ground up?

3. Crab cakes or pit beef?",2018-11-19,13:44,
"Hello Mr Elias, 

Thank you for doing this AMA. As a long time Oriole fan, I am very excited to see what you and your team will do to build this organization back to its winning ways.

So for the past few years we have heard through reports that the Orioles front office has had too many chiefs and not enough Indians. We have no clue how true this is but the reports were that Dan didn't have full control over decisions. Example: Brady Anderson making decisions or Peter Angelo's wanting Davis so much we bid against ourselves to get him.

So my question is, do you have 100% control over the rebuild and the baseball decisions? 

Thanks from a very optimistic Orioles fan! ",2018-11-19,13:26,
"Hi Mike, 

Back in the day, the Orioles were competitive for nearly three full decades based off a process called the “Oriole Way” which was a process heavily relying on scouting, professionalism and player development. How important will these things be in establishing the new generation of Baltimore O’s players? 

Thanks you so much, was really excited for the hire. Here’s to a great time! 👍",2018-11-19,13:36,
What are your thoughts on re-signing Adam Jones?   John and Lou spoke about big picture and commitment to the community.  No Orioles player has done more for Baltimore in the last 10+ years.   Adam plays the game the right way and will be a good leader for our young guys. ,2018-11-19,13:38,

"Hello Mike,

I'm a bit late to the party, as many questions without replies have stacked up, but wish to pose a question about analytics with regard to a hitter's approach at the plate. 

From watching Oriole hitters recently, especially this past season, there seemed to be a take the first pitch approach with some, while others would be more aggressive (looking at Machado and Jones here even though they are with other teams) at the plate. 

My question becomes thus, would analytics dictate an aggressive approach to a pitcher with a high first pitch strike percentage, and conversely, taking a more cautious approach with a low first pitch strike percentage? Or does it depend on the number of pitches/type of pitches/frequency of use for each pitch that dictates a hitter's thinking at the plate?

I ask because much of the lineup appeared lost, especially with off-speed and breaking balls. Enough to where it became our Achilles's heel.",2018-11-21,01:16,
"Hey Mr. Elias, huge Orioles fan, and now a huge fan of yours, I am a young fan (15) so I’m sort of new to the change of management for the Orioles but I must say, I am pleased how it’s turned out so far! So to my question, I read a book about the Cubs and when Theo Epstein took over and what he did to “break the curse” in Chicago, one of the things was completely changing the outlook of how things are done. He wrote basically a rule book I believe and just rewrote the “culture.” So my question is, is that how it’s going to be in Baltimore? A complete overhaul of everything? Or do you see some new ideas you like in Baltimore already? And also how much of the way things are done in Houston or St. Louis be shown in this rebuild in terms of structure?

Thanks, sorry for the long question, and hopefully one day I can be working aside you in the Orioles front office in just a few years possibly. Welcome to Baltimore!",2018-11-19,17:09,

I have a few questions about the state of the franchise and any you could spare time to answer would be greatly appreciated!
1) where do you view the Orioles' farm system compared to the league and how do you plan to fill it with talent for the future?
2) many fans have been disheartened by talented pitchers not reaching their potential in the organization (Arrieta, Gausman, Bundy etc) How can the team better develop and coach their arms for success?

"Welcome Mr. Elias!

I've been an Orioles fan as long as I can remember. I think my earliest memories go back to 1964 and I was fortunate to have my early fan years intersect some of the Orioles strongest seasons. I'm hoping for a new resurgence.

I've got some thoughts on alternatives to the traditional five-man rotation, ones that leverages many short stints by middle relievers instead of relying on long outings by ""starters.""  I've written up a brief summery. It's called ""The Nine-man Rotation."" It's only a few pages, but I believe it effectively covers the concept.  I'd be honored if you would have the time to read it.

"Hey Mike,

  
Thanks for doing this and welcome to Birdland!  

&amp;#x200B;

\- Your approach seems to be based on the level of risk associated with a pick, a signing, etc.

  \- In the example of a high school pitcher being a #1 draft pick, I would assume you look at it being a higher risk than a college pitcher simply because there are more variables involved in them being successful.

&amp;#x200B;

For every Carlos Correa, there is a Mark Appel (if this is too soon, my apologies.)

With the addition of you to this franchise, I am once again optimistic about the future of Orioles baseball.

That being said, what are your thoughts on the current state of the minor league system and prospects within the organization? There were some big additions through trades this past season, but a majority of places still see the system as in the basement among all major league clubs.

I think the fan base rightfully has the expectation that we’re not going to be a contender this year. With that being said, are there any specific types of players that you’ll be targeting via free agency or trade this offseason to help the near-term competitiveness? i.e. inning-eating 4th/5th starter type, bullpen arms with years of team control that could become trade-able assets, a defensive specialist shortstop/platoon outfielder, etc. ",2018-11-19,13:32,

Clearly (and this is something fans/pundits have been discussing for quite awhile) the Orioles have historically rejected key areas of modern team building, like analytics and international talent acquisition.

What foundations do we have to build on re: international talent, and what steps do we need to take to elevate our international pipeline to another level long-term? Do you see international talent as a sort of equalizer for a small market team like ours?

I know it isn't easy to get to specific when trying to predict the future, so instead do you have goals or plans that you'd be willing to share for 1 month down the road? 1 year? 3 years? etc?

2nd question: the Orioles made a lot of moves this past trade deadline to get many middle-of-the-road prospects as well as a lot of international signing money. What is your plan moving forward with what has already been laid down from Duquette's rebuild start?",2018-11-19,13:27,
"Mike,

Welcome to Baltimore. I am ecstatic about your hire and look forward to your Plan.

What is your first order of business after all members of your team/Front office, field manager are in place?. Where do u begin?

As a former pitcher How Hard did you throw at your Highest level?

Do You need any additional Domestic scouts for the Baltimore / Maryland area?

There is alot of good talent in this area, as a local travel Tournament team coach for 16u.. ",2018-11-19,13:43,
"Thanks for coming!

As a new GM on a rebuilding team, does the team give you a time frame in which they expect to be competitive? Do they say something like ""by x years we expect to be competing for the division""? If so, do you think that would cause you to take greater risks as that time approached? 

I'll certainly understand if especially that second question can't be answered, but it's something I've always wondered. ",2018-11-19,14:04,
"Mike, 

One more question. I think we were all a bit disappointed that the team put all their eggs in the international basket (and came away empty) last season. How do you plan on rebuilding the farm system when most of our tradeable assets have already been moved? Primarily through the draft or are there still other avenues you can explore? Also, what is your tentative timetable for the rebuild? Thanks for your answer!",2018-11-19,14:01,
"Welcome to Baltimore, Mike...we're excited to have you!

1) How are you building out your analytics team? There are many great data nerds in Baltimore that work in advertising/marketing tech and business intelligence that would love working for you

2) Do you really have free reign? This would signal a fundamental shift for us fans...

&amp;#x200B;

3) When does Bill Ripken start as the new Manager?",2018-11-19,14:06,
"Hey Mike, I am thrilled that you are going to be our GM and wish you nothing by success!

A couple of former O's talked about how different the approach was with other teams in terms of the use of analytics, and pitchers always seemed to have more success elsewhere.

How much do you think an expanded analytical approach could improve Orioles pitching already at the Major League level?",2018-11-19,13:35,
"First of all, welcome to Baltimore and I couldn't be more excited about your hiring.  Seems like ownership took their time and really did their due diligence in taking the organization in a new direction.

"Mike, 

Welcome to Baltimore! Excited to have you on board. It seems like, in the past, there has been some real confusion about roles and responsibilities of some employees within the organization. Do you plan on better defining those roles and being more transparent with the fans about what they are? Thanks in advance for your answer. ",2018-11-19,13:57,

The orioles haven’t had an ace in a long long time. Someone that can start and give you a QS 70% of the time. It’s proven that a 2 strong man rotation can take you to the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

The Orioles analytics department, especially with recent departures, is very much a blank slate.

Also, Blue Crabs or King Crab Legs?",2018-11-19,13:42,

"Mike, 

It's great to have you on board! Are there any specific positions you anticipate trying to fill via free agency this off season? Or will the focus be more on saving money, working with what we have, and giving some of our younger players a chance to gain valuable experience at the MLB level? ",2018-11-19,14:33,
"I never expected this. 

Mike, considering the Orioles payroll and the fact that analytics isn't the advantage to small market teams that it used to be.  How do you plan to compete with Boston and NY considering their payrolls and analytics expenditures (Boston not so much as far as analytics). ",2018-11-19,14:36,
"Welcome to Birdland, Mike! Your hiring has been amazing news, and I’m thrilled to have you on board.

2. Do you feel the ""win"" as a pitcher stat is a good indicator of a quality starter? (Both deGrom, and Giolito had 10 wins in 32 starts this season) 

3. Do you believe in allowing a pitcher to develop a cutter?",2018-11-19,13:54,
Do you plan on putting an emphasis on building a Latino-friendly culture throughout the organization? The game has become multi-cultural and having a level of familiarity for International prospects seems to be a major selling point for young kids coming from Latin America. ,2018-11-19,15:16,

How will the total annual payroll for the team be determined? Do you have full autonomy to spend as much money as you want, or will John and Lou give you a budget to work with and will you be able to go outside that if necessary on your own?",2018-11-19,13:46,

"Do people not talk about the constant rumors of steroid use attached to Davis out of politeness?  From me on the outside not following his career until the hitless streak, his rise and fall looks just like any other PED user who signs a gigantic guaranteed contract and no longer needs to juice.

All this talk about ""fixing his swing"" is meaningless if what we are seeing simply IS Chris Davis, minus all the steroid fed beef.  The Orioles organization would be doing no one any favors if they keep trotting him out there hoping he would ""rediscover"" something he never actually had without a drug he no longer needs to use.

"I’m Brandon Hyde, new Orioles manager AMA

I hail from Santa Rosa, California. I graduated from Long Beach State University (CA) and then spent four seasons as a player in the White Sox system before beginning my coaching career. I’ve spent 16 professional seasons in various coaching positions, including as the Chicago Cubs director of player development. Most recently, I served as the bench coach for the Cubs. I was a part of the team who helped bring winning baseball back to Chicago, including a World Series title in 2016.

I’m proud to be the 20th manager in Orioles history and I’m excited to get to work. I look forward to reading your questions.

Ask me anything!

"Welcome to Charm City! Very excited to have you in Birdland. 

I think Os fans understand that we are in the early stages of a rebuild and that going from the worst record in baseball to playing in October doesn’t happen overnight. With that being the case, how are you going to define success in your first season? Obviously every team wants to go to the playoffs every year, but for a team just starting from the ground up, what do you want to see a year from now as evidence that we’re on the right track?",2018-12-17,22:29,
"I sure do love the lead time! Here ~~is my TED Talk~~ are my questions. 

Tell us what sold you on the opportunity to come to Baltimore? What did Mike Elias tell you, what did the Angelos brothers tell you, what did you see in this team and its potential that made you want to get in on the ground floor?

I imagine you’re still in the process of making calls and booking flights, but the Orioles are a team depleted of lots of veterans, lots of talent, from Hardy to Machado to Gausman to Jones. While the Orioles have no realistic shot at a pennant next year, leadership is key to developing the talent to get it some years from now. Is there somebody on the roster who you see as being The Guy (whether you’re ready to name him or not) and/or is there somebody you and Elias might sign or trade for to be The Guy?

Before putting pen to paper, did you seek counsel from Joe Maddon or any of your peers across the league? While I understand some conversations between friends you’ll want to remain between friends, what was a bit of advice you got from somebody that stuck out to you?

The Orioles of 2019 are very much a blank slate, but they’re a franchise with a rich past, one commemorated in bronze, etched into the pavement and personified in Brooks Robinson, who you got to meet Monday. While I don’t expect you to be able to name everybody who put on the uniform or commiserate over the annus horribilis of 2005, tell us about something either from over the course of your career outside the organization or your several days inside it that struck you about the history of baseball in Baltimore. On a personal note, I’d recommend you take a stroll a few blocks off to the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum.",2018-12-18,00:24,

"Hey Brandon, welcome to Birdland and thanks for taking the time to answer questions.

 In the press conference, you alluded to the fact that you'll be  collaborating with Mike Elias and the rest of the front office. Does that mean you'll be intimately involved in personnel decisions. If so, what is the general plan in free agency at this point in the process? What are some areas of need you anticipate going after?

Also, is your daughter named Arya, as in Arya Stark? I'm not sure if I heard it correctly. 

I wish you a long and successful tenure here in Baltimore. Go O's!",2018-12-17,23:33,

We as fans aren't really used to this kind of interaction from the team so this is very much appreciated. I was wondering how you go about learning about learning about the Orioles organization.

What are some good alternative ways to define success this year besides wins and losses?",2018-12-17,22:24,
"Hey, I am a younger baseball fan (15) and I have always been drawn to the management side of the game. I really admire that you worked your way up in the different organizations and in the baseball industry. I was wondering were you always drawn to managing and coaching or was it after you played minor league ball? And also, how did you end up with your first job in baseball management? Were you a good candidate because you played for a few years or what? 

Also I go to Greensboro Grasshoppers games fairly often and I believe the first game I went to was in 2006, if only I had known their manager then, was going to be the manager of my favorite team now lol.

Thanks, Ryan.",2018-12-18,11:36,
"Hi Brandon! Traditionally, after Buck Showalter leaves an organization, that team wins a pennant the next year. Do you feel that the obvious implied expectation puts any extra pressure on you?

"Hi Brandon. Thank you for doing this. Really looking forward to seeing how you can right this ship. I'm especially invested because a few of my friends are playing in the O's system and I hope that they can be a big  part of your team in a couple years.

Anyway, here's my question:

Who do you feel has the chance to really break out on this team, be it a prospect or current member of the roster and make a huge difference in improving the O's win total?


",2018-12-18,10:56,
"Hi Brandon! Can’t wait for the new Elias-Hyde era to begin. Wishing you best of luck.

You saw it first hand, what did the Cubs do with Arrietta that we didn’t do? The same can be said for other pitchers. But was this an organizational fault by the Orioles? Brilliance by the Cubs? Random luck?... and if it’s an organizational fault, do you think Elias and your staff will be able to produce a true homegrown ace for the first time in a long time?",2018-12-18,11:02,
"What are you going to do coming into a clubhouse that might still be a little biased towards Buck?

Welcome!  How would you describe your coaching style? ,2018-12-17,22:00,
"I'm really looking forward to seeing your managing style as you work with our team. 

I have 2 questions:

1. When working with young players, the previous leadership was criticized for trying to teach players away from their instincts, especially pitchers. We've heard Jake Arrieta criticize the organization, Dylan Bundy talk about the organization not wanting him to throw a cutter. What is your philosophy regarding players and their natural tendencies?

2. Speaking to that, the previous leadership embraced a philosophy of high home run numbers, high strikeouts and incredibly low walk totals. How will you as manager work to increase the Orioles OBP, and encourage more plate discipline and patience overall?",2018-12-18,00:30,

To get to it, my question is what are your personal first steps as manager for our club? What is your priority list. What do you expect to be the biggest challenges here? 

Finally, I like small ball, how do you feel about focusing on keeping the ball in the park and being aggressive on base. We haven't had big base stealers since Roberts and Patterson.

Thank for taking the time to read my question and hopefully answer it! Can't wait for the season to start, I haven't been this excited in years for what the Orioles are doing.",2018-12-17,23:13,
"Welcome to Baltimore!  From a personal standpoint, have you spent much time in Baltimore? if so what is your favorite thing, if not what are you most excited about seeing/doing?",2018-12-17,22:35,
"Good morning, and welcome to Baltimore! It's a pleasure to have you here, and I'm sure you'll do a phenomenal job with the team.

The use of Sabermetrics/Analytical observations within organizations seems to be a contentious issue within the sport for a lot of fans, how do you intend to balance the usage of modern tactics (Opener, more aggressive usage of shifts) with traditional focus on player development? How did your experience working with Joe in Chicago impact your views on managing? 

Thank you so much for your time!",2018-12-18,10:44,
"Hi Brandon!!!!! First of all welcome to Baltimore!!!!! All this buzz is getting me  excited for Orioles baseball again next year! What are some managerial aspects that you bring to the table that we might not have seen just yet? Also, is this a new approach that the O's are taking to better connect with the fans. Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to answer our questions and LET'S GO O'S!!!!!! Good luck in 2019 and can't wait to see you run down the orange carpet on Opening Day!!!!!",2018-12-17,21:56,
"I think its cool that we now get this direct avenue to a professional sports organization manager. It stinks going into such a tough situation, yet the only direction to go is up. Do you think coaches/managers in pro sports (i guess there’s more leeway in baseball) should get more benefit of the doubt when they inherit a team with poor/doubtful prospects? Like in football its one year/even half a year or youre out. Even though the team itself (though they’ll never say it of course) just stinks?",2018-12-18,10:50,

When you look towards the 2019 season, what do you want to see from the young roster?

What kind of timeline, realistically, could fans expect before we start seeing the transition from full rebuild to real on-field success, +/- 5 years?",2018-12-18,07:52,
"Welcome, Brandon! Happy to have you!

You spent quite a while under Joe Maddon who is seen as a bit of an ""outside the box"" thinker. Further, Mike Elias has spoken at length about the implementation of analytics across the organization. Do you see yourself as someone who is open to incorporating analytics in your approach to roster management, coaching, lineup construction, etc? What ways might we see this in your approach to managing?",2018-12-18,09:29,

"Both you and Elias have done or are doing these AMAs very quickly upon taking the job. That's great, and I think it goes a long way towards getting fan engagement, but I'm wondering where the direction is coming from? Is it just coincidence that we hire a new GM and Manager and that seems to come along with more active fan engagement, or is this a sign of new influence in the organization? ",2018-12-18,10:27,

"If a veteran with a large contract struggles at the plate or on the field or on the mound in a way that is significantly impacting the performance of the team (sub-.200 AVG, or multiple errors a week, or &gt; 6.00 ERA, for example), how long of a leash do you let that player have to correct their performance/show improvement?  Until the end of April?  Until the All-Star break?

Obviously you don't want to pull the plug too soon as a player may figure things out eventually (like Kendrys Morales did for the Blue Jays this season), but there has to be a point where you have to make the tough decision.",2018-12-18,10:33,
"Hey Brandon, very glad to have you and Mike a part of Birdland. Excited for the future of this ball club. Working with Joe Maddon and experiencing that kind of success with the Cubs must've been great.

"So random thought....why do they have champagne and all that shit in the locker room after making a 1 game play in wild card game? Before they put the wild card game in, if two teams were tied at the end of the year they'd go to a 1 game play in match. Those teams wouldn't celebrate like this because it could end in 1 game. Why do they have the extravagant celebration just for extending your season 1 game. I could see it after the WC game.",2016-10-03,11:24,
