"I know many of you will probably yeet me out the window before you read the entirety of this post, but fellow baseball nerds, please hear me out!

Let me start out by saying that I was NOT a fan of Cash pulling Snell in THAT scenario. Snell was locked in, and visibly, his stuff was as sharp as it had been from pitch 1. Even though Betts has an .892 career OPS against him, the Rays BP had been anything but reliable to that point in the series, and that is especially pronounced with how poorly Anderson had been pitching all postseason.

HOWEVA...let me get into why the Rays just fleeced the Padres. You guys, as a fanbase, enjoy being a *very* competitive team year in and year out, right? There is a very poignant reason for why you guys are able to do that. Speaking as a Tigers fan, who has seen his team become an abomination due to a formerly, chronically barren farm system and inexhaustible spending on players well past their prime, I am green with envy at your front office, and frankly, your shrewd ownership. Yes, Stu is a dick. Yes, I would be furious with the veiled and not-so-veiled allusions to moving the team. Yes, it would be very annoying to see your favorite team be the baseball version of Ebenezer Scrooge, while everyone knows they could easily afford a high-tier payroll.

But THE main reason the Rays remain competitive year in and year out is because of moves like this: trading big leaguers at their peak or right when they start their decline, and relying on their renowned player development and scouting to expedite these supplemental prospects to the Bigs to backfill lost production. Hording cost-controlled prospects on a mass scale allows the team to be extremely well-balanced for years. This gives the team options: Options on when to spend for a FA to fill a hole, options to spend big on a short term trade to make a run at a WS, etc. You guys know this. I'm preaching to the choir.

I know Snellzilla is a fan favorite. I know you probably think he just got dealt for some slapdick prospects, and now he's riding away from you on a trusty steed into the horizon. Blake is on the decline though. Please take a breath as you feel your blood pressure rise from reading that. I say this because of a few reasons:

First, very real durability concerns. I mean this from both a health and inefficiency perspective. Blake is known as an ""Ace"" right? What is the #1 criteria for an Ace? It's arguably dependability, right? What makes a pitcher dependable? I would argue that it's taking the mound every 5th day, and going deep into games, consistently. What is the widely-accepted, blanket number for SP durability? That 30 start threshold, right? Snell has eclipsed the 30 start threshold a grand total of *once* in his career. And he hasn't even hit the mid-high 20's in those other years.  How about the games he does start? 

Of the 108 starts in Blake Snell's career, he has eclipsed:

6 innings: only 43 times

7 innings: only *13* times

8 innings: ZERO times

I don't know about you, but when I think of ""Aces,"" I think of guys like JV, Mad Max, Kershaw, Cole, etc. These are guys who you constantly see grinding into the 7th-9th innings because they pitch so well and so efficiently up to that point in the game that they make their managers' decisons easy. And these are guys who have played for managers and clubs that are *very* analytically-inclined. 

Now WAIT! Wait. I know what you're thinking. ""Well Snell doesn't go deep into games because Cash pulls him so quickly."" Well, let's trust Kevin Cash here. This is a man who is very, very well-regarded amongst his peers who are at the pinnacle of their profession. These are men and women who are so good and smart at what they do, that they get paid MILLIONS of dollars for their services in an uber-competitive industry, while leading teams of Ivy League data scientists and statisticians. Kevin Cash knows what he's doing. You think he would habitually take Snell out of games early on a whim? On the ""eyetest""? Just because he feels his taint starting to tickle? 

This is where Snell stans would normally tout his amazing surface level stats and awards. ""He's got a career 3.24 ERA! He's struck out 648 batters in 556 innings! He won the 2018 CY!"" Yes, but baseball is a ""What have you done for me lately?"" kinda profession. Teams evaluate, pay, and trade players based on projections; on what they hypothesize a player will do in the *future*, not necessarily only what was done in years past. Or at least that's how good teams operate (Looking at you, Tigers-pre-rebuild.)

Can't at least part of that sparkly bottom line be attributed to Cash's wisdom and savvy decision-making in taking him out before those numbers got any worse? Snell's velocity has fallen 10 percentile in the past 2 seasons. His batted ball profile has gotten much worse. His vertical and horizontal movement have receded rather dramatically on all of his pitches except his curveball horizontally, which is probably not even a good thing. 

Blake Snell is a good pitcher though! But the way the Rays deployed him made him even better. Is he an Ace? No, I don't think so. Is he a top 30 SP in baseball? Yes, I think so. Does the arbitrary title of ""Ace"" even mean anything substantive? No, probably not.

Back to the trade though. The best part of this deal for the Padres is Snell's relative team-friendly contract over the next 3 years (10.5, 12.5, 16). The Rays likely backloaded this deal because they knew his decline was inevitable, and that they would trade him anyways. I think they traded him at the peak of his value. What better time than after his masterful WS performance? Him being a lefty also greatly balances out a Padres rotation that just lost Clevy, and already has an overrated-Paddack, a fragile Lamet, a BABIP-friendly Davies, and an unproven or largely meh remainder of potential starters to choose from.

HOWEVA, the Rays get back the #3, 7, and 14 prospects (MLB.com) from a premiere SD farm system, as well as a very toolsy 25 year old, switch-hitting catcher with MLB experience, who was once a top prospect himself not too long ago. Don't you trust the Rays Player Development system to turn Mejia around? I sure do. He'll be the perfect platoon with Zunino. Heck, with the way pitchers peak and plummet so dramatically these days, Patino could be better than Snell as soon as THIS season! Patino is gushing with talent. Cole Wilcox is yet another behemoth for the Rays to tinker with, who can hit triple digits and has two plus offspeed offerings. Does that fit their specialty or what? Hunt adds to their plethora of catching depth; a position that is notorious for having prospects not pan out, or at least not pan out for long.

And the amazing thing is that Snell is expendable for the Rays! Even with losing him and Uncle Chuck, the Rays still have absurd pitching depth in their rotation and bullpen.

This is exactly the type of strategy, pragmatism, and ideology that keeps the Rays raysin'. You guys will be more than fine. You will thrive for the next decade.

"Full disclosure I‚Äôm a Padres fan but I saw this on r/baseball and wanted to respond. 

From just a value perspective I think this is a solid deal for the Rays (obviously it‚Äôs bad for baseball that things like this happen, but if you‚Äôre gonna move Snell this is a good return for him), but I feel the need to chime in because I think OP is setting some unrealistic expectations for the return. Patino is a great prospect who has a ton of potential, but this post isn‚Äôt accurately portraying how developed he is. Tbh I doubt he‚Äôll see much of any major league action next year, it was pretty obvious watching the Padres last season that we rushed him up (which we do a lot tbh). His control was really bad last year and his secondaries need some extra development too, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll have too much trouble working his pitches and his control should approach league average as he gets a feel for his entire arsenal. The only thing that worried me about him is his height and that‚Äôs just because he reminds me of Anderson Espinoza (as a short pitcher with a ton of velocity). Mejia, at least imo, is the 4th guy in this trade. He was already starting to show signs of decline when we traded for him and that hasn‚Äôt slowed at all. He‚Äôs not a very good fielder behind the plate so most his value is in his bat which has been dead for the past few years. Wilcox is the prototypical second half of the first round pick, he‚Äôs got electric stuff but he needs to work on making better use of it (he‚Äôs very hittable rn which makes a lot of people think he‚Äôll be a reliever). Hunt is actually the sleeper guy in this trade and I know a lot of Padres fans have been buzzing about him.

I don't have a problem with the trade for value reasons. I have a problem with the trade because its part of a bigger issue with management.

"If Snell was kept in a couple extra innings and ended up giving up 2 more runs, nobody would say anything, it would just be bad luck. The catastrophic reaction here is more of a product of status quo bias than the wrong-ness of this decision.

For all we know, Morton would have given up a couple extra runs if he was kept in against the Astros. His managerial style is based on making decisions that often feel wrong but, on average, work out better than just instinct. Overall, the strategy works, *and there's no perfect way of predicting when it won't*.

I still lean on this being a bad decision *given the match-up that he was taken out for*, but people are over-reacting so much. Cash brought us to a world series with a roster much worse than other teams at this level.

" Hello and welcome to the Rays subreddit, I am your friendly /r/TampaBayRays Moderator and heart-throb /u/RyeWhiskeyy. Allow me to be your guide on the epic journey that is Rays Baseball.

As some of you may or may not have known, The Rays have been playing professional baseball since the late 1900's. They are Located in St. Petersburg Fla, ( I know, I know, But St.Pete is in the Tampa Bay Area, so close enough, right?) a historic baseball community. They are owned by Stu Sternberg, a Wall street investor. Leading the front office are Matt Silverman and Eric Neander. With Coach Kevin Cash managing on the field.


For a guide to the previous 2018 season [read my toast from Toast from the baseball subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/al9yzo/a_toast_to_the_tampa_bay_rays/?) /r/Baseball, That is also a great sub if you haven't already.

Have a look at our [roster](http://m.rays.mlb.com/roster/) and familiarize yourself with some of our team. Some sub favorites are Tommy Pham, ji-Man Choi, Tyler Glasnow, Austin Meadows and Brandon Lower.

Now baseball is a game played between two teams of 9 players, When the offensive team comes up to bat, They have 3 chances or "" Outs"" to move players on to base and down the baseline.  They can reach base by getting a hit, getting walked ( When a pitcher throws 4 garbage pitches that the hitter doesn't swing at also known as ""Balls"") getting hit by a pitch, balk and there are a few others I guess but these are the important ones. Each individual batter can swing at the ball until they have either accumulated 3 swings that did not hit anything called "" strikes""or 4 balls, as we previously discussed. At this point, they are either get a hit, are out or take 1st base. Each team gets three outs per inning, and there are 9 innings, so be prepared to watch a game for at a minimum of at least 5 or 6 hours.

Now the defenses job is to Pitch the ball , that guys job is to throw nasty pitches, in the strike zone, or Umpires zone of bullshit, to strike out the other team. If the ball is hit into play, Its up to the fielders to field the ball and assist with getting the out by either catching the ball or throwing the ball to whatever base a offensive player is running too. Multiple outs can be gotten in a single play.

Anyways, that's enough explaining baseball to you, I know it seems complicated, but its not and you will understand it soon enough.  

Now the Rays play at a historic field named for a wonderful juice brand called Tropicana. You Lightning fans may know it as it was once home your hockey team. Well, a lot has changed since then and I can guarantee that there probably isn't any ice on the field anymore. Now, a lot of people like to talk shit about the Trop, They say its ugly and disgrace to baseball, so In that instance Rule number 1 is always Defend the Trop, I don't care if you hate it, It's ours and you are going to fucking like it. If any silly Yankees fan talks shit about the Trop and brags about the 27 rings their team won 2,000 years ago, tell them to shove it. Literally shove the Trop up there ass, Its spherical so it shouldn't be to hard.

So why should you bandwagon the Rays and not some other loser ass team? Well, The Rays are simply different. If you didn't know, The Rays have one of the lowest payrolls in baseball, they rely on atypical strategies like Openers, bullpenning, defensive shifts etc that baseball traditionalist hate. But fuck them. Not only are the Rays not afraid to try new things, but they are also fairly successful at it. After using these strategies to take a team predicted to win 60-ish games to competing for wild card spot, many people are looking at baseball differently as the Rays are at the forefront of baseball innovation. Gone are the days or peanuts and crackerjacks and getting sucked off underneath the right field bleachers. Today is about pulled pork nachos, petting stingrays in left field and Blake Snell streaming fortnite for some reason. You guys are privileged to  watch history in the making and by privileged I mean getting to watch Ryne Stanek (Crack Thor) get 30 game starts with only 50 innings pitched. 

I hope by now you guys have realized this post is a joke, so welcome to the subreddit and please don't forget to join our discord https://discord.gg/fNKTfgj and as always, Defend the Trop. I swear to god you need to physically threaten people if they talk shit about the Trop.",2019-04-17,['401074991'],TB
"You mentioned a balk, but didn't explain what it is. Which can be frustrating to new fans because it's not very self-evident, so I figured I'd post the official balk rules for people new to baseball.

# Balk Rules

1. You can't just be up there and just doin' a balk like that.

1a. A balk is when you

1b. Okay well listen. A balk is when you balk the

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The pitcher is not allowed to do a motion to the, uh, batter, that prohibits the batter from doing, you know, just trying to hit the ball. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the pitcher is in the stretch, he can't be over here and say to the runner, like, ""I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna tag you out! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to pitch and then don't pitch, you have to still pitch. You cannot not pitch. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, throwing motion of the ball, and then, until you just throw it.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have the ball up here, like this, but then there's the balk you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. Fairuza Balk hasn't been in any movies in forever. I hope she wasn't typecast as that racist lady in American History X.

1c-b(2)-b(i). Oh wait, she was in The Waterboy too! That would be even worse.

1c-b(2)-b(ii). ""get in mah bellah"" -- Adam Water, ""The Waterboy."" Haha, classic...

1c-b(3). Okay seriously though. A balk is when the pitcher makes a movement that, as determined by, when you do a move involving the baseball and field of
