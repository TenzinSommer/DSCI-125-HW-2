"Dumping good players is the biggest problem with this franchise. Durham should celebrate when the Rays win.

Fuck the blue jays,2023-12-09,15:25
"I have no ill will towards the Dodgers.  In fact, part of me is glad he‚Äôs going to the NL; the other part of me is a little bummed because I would have loved to see Ohtani numerous times throughout the year as the Blue Jays star-studded offense leads them to another 3rd or 4th place finish in the AL East.",2023-12-09,15:40
Dodgers can have him. The salt in Toronto is amazing though.,2023-12-09,15:40

Why? That‚Äôs the same amount of money we‚Äôd spend on team payroll for 10 years. We can‚Äôt win with 1 player. I‚Äôd rather watch our guys work and play hard than be the Dodgers.,2023-12-09,16:15

"Eh, I mean the Dodgers have Andrew Friedman, so I almost feel as if they are what we could be if we had their money to spend. They've put together a deep organization and it's hard to hate on a team that's not really a rival (we were underdogs in the WS against them) And as stated before at least we don't have to face him 13 times a year in the division.",2023-12-10,10:43
"I‚Äôm confused. Did you think we were going to sign Ohtani? 

You had me worried we traded Randy",2023-12-09,16:49

"Well he won't be an auto AL MVP anymore, meaning we have a chance now lol. And it's much better than him going to a division rival. I mean, way better. 

When I heard we were getting something like an extra $50 million more than last season for 2024 a tiny part me decided that it was because we were gonna buy Ohtani just for one year to make the WS lmao

Of course that was never going to happen. But we should be getting a big payroll boost for next year, which is nice.",2023-12-10,15:45
"O‚Äôs fan here, Reddit randomly made this post show up.

We should both be glad he‚Äôs as far away from the AL East as possible",2023-12-11,22:43
This is why baseball needs a salary cap.,2023-12-09,16:48
"Unpopular opinion, apparently, but I‚Äôm sad Ohtani isn‚Äôt in the AL East. Being able to face off against such a historic player on the regular would‚Äôve been awesome. Even with Ohtani, I still think the Jays are a mid team. 

However, I‚Äôm also happy he‚Äôs on the Dodgers because fuck the Jays. They don‚Äôt deserve Ohtani and it would‚Äôve been a real shame to have such an amazing talent being managed by fucking Schneider.",2023-12-09,18:37

"Hey, at least you have Adam the Woo, Tampa Bay Jay, and Cowbell Max. Be happy about that!",2023-12-09,23:33
"  

Is this the real life? Yes, Saint Ohtani has officially clipped his wings for the jolly trolly Dodgers of Loser Angeles.

As one of the many men who loves Ohtani more than his significant other, I am sad to see him to stay in LA. I don‚Äôt know why it really makes a difference to me for him to go from red to blue, but it does sadden a Saint Ohtani fan... To quote ‚ÄúBaseball Is Dead‚Äù, where Jared said. ‚Äú10 Years at 700 million dollars. He is making 50 dollars a second, 50 dollars a second. Per month 11.7 million dollars, per game 432,000 dollars, per hour 180,041 dollars, per at bat 108,025 dollars, per inning 48,011 dollars, per minute 3,001 dollars, per second 50 dollars and one cent. That is what he will earn from the Dodgers for the next ten seasons from Hector Gomez and LA Dodgers.‚Äù 

The mathematics are staggering in this deal, and yes he is worth more than that price stated above. 

Amen Saint Ohtani.",2023-12-10,04:14

Hell yeah! Dude made his debut in the World Series and is starting the the All Star Game in LA a couple years later in the middle of a historic run. What a moment in Shane's career!

-The Tigers never had that great of a roster, they just peaked at the right time and gave their fans something to be excited about. It was a miracle that they even made the playoffs to begin with given how they performed for the better part of the regular season. 


-The Royals are a fine team, but nothing special. They went 86-76. Sure, they have have a few heavy hitters like Witt Jr, Perez, and Lugo, but they definitely lack depth. 


-The Astros simply aren‚Äôt the Astros of old. Not much more to say on that. 


-The Orioles were good but they tried too hard to be like us and did what we did in the WC round of the playoffs last year. 


-Guardians have a good squad but were a lackluster 34-32 post ASB. That‚Äôs a nightmare heading into the playoffs.

"I know many of you will probably yeet me out the window before you read the entirety of this post, but fellow baseball nerds, please hear me out!

Let me start out by saying that I was NOT a fan of Cash pulling Snell in THAT scenario. Snell was locked in, and visibly, his stuff was as sharp as it had been from pitch 1. Even though Betts has an .892 career OPS against him, the Rays BP had been anything but reliable to that point in the series, and that is especially pronounced with how poorly Anderson had been pitching all postseason.

HOWEVA...let me get into why the Rays just fleeced the Padres. You guys, as a fanbase, enjoy being a *very* competitive team year in and year out, right? There is a very poignant reason for why you guys are able to do that. Speaking as a Tigers fan, who has seen his team become an abomination due to a formerly, chronically barren farm system and inexhaustible spending on players well past their prime, I am green with envy at your front office, and frankly, your shrewd ownership. Yes, Stu is a dick. Yes, I would be furious with the veiled and not-so-veiled allusions to moving the team. Yes, it would be very annoying to see your favorite team be the baseball version of Ebenezer Scrooge, while everyone knows they could easily afford a high-tier payroll.

But THE main reason the Rays remain competitive year in and year out is because of moves like this: trading big leaguers at their peak or right when they start their decline, and relying on their renowned player development and scouting to expedite these supplemental prospects to the Bigs to backfill lost production. Hording cost-controlled prospects on a mass scale allows the team to be extremely well-balanced for years. This gives the team options: Options on when to spend for a FA to fill a hole, options to spend big on a short term trade to make a run at a WS, etc. You guys know this. I'm preaching to the choir.

I know Snellzilla is a fan favorite. I know you probably think he just got dealt for some slapdick prospects, and now he's riding away from you on a trusty steed into the horizon. Blake is on the decline though. Please take a breath as you feel your blood pressure rise from reading that. I say this because of a few reasons:

First, very real durability concerns. I mean this from both a health and inefficiency perspective. Blake is known as an ""Ace"" right? What is the #1 criteria for an Ace? It's arguably dependability, right? What makes a pitcher dependable? I would argue that it's taking the mound every 5th day, and going deep into games, consistently. What is the widely-accepted, blanket number for SP durability? That 30 start threshold, right? Snell has eclipsed the 30 start threshold a grand total of *once* in his career. And he hasn't even hit the mid-high 20's in those other years.  How about the games he does start? 

Of the 108 starts in Blake Snell's career, he has eclipsed:

6 innings: only 43 times

7 innings: only *13* times

8 innings: ZERO times

I don't know about you, but when I think of ""Aces,"" I think of guys like JV, Mad Max, Kershaw, Cole, etc. These are guys who you constantly see grinding into the 7th-9th innings because they pitch so well and so efficiently up to that point in the game that they make their managers' decisons easy. And these are guys who have played for managers and clubs that are *very* analytically-inclined. 

Now WAIT! Wait. I know what you're thinking. ""Well Snell doesn't go deep into games because Cash pulls him so quickly."" Well, let's trust Kevin Cash here. This is a man who is very, very well-regarded amongst his peers who are at the pinnacle of their profession. These are men and women who are so good and smart at what they do, that they get paid MILLIONS of dollars for their services in an uber-competitive industry, while leading teams of Ivy League data scientists and statisticians. Kevin Cash knows what he's doing. You think he would habitually take Snell out of games early on a whim? On the ""eyetest""? Just because he feels his taint starting to tickle? 

This is where Snell stans would normally tout his amazing surface level stats and awards. ""He's got a career 3.24 ERA! He's struck out 648 batters in 556 innings! He won the 2018 CY!"" Yes, but baseball is a ""What have you done for me lately?"" kinda profession. Teams evaluate, pay, and trade players based on projections; on what they hypothesize a player will do in the *future*, not necessarily only what was done in years past. Or at least that's how good teams operate (Looking at you, Tigers-pre-rebuild.)

Can't at least part of that sparkly bottom line be attributed to Cash's wisdom and savvy decision-making in taking him out before those numbers got any worse? Snell's velocity has fallen 10 percentile in the past 2 seasons. His batted ball profile has gotten much worse. His vertical and horizontal movement have receded rather dramatically on all of his pitches except his curveball horizontally, which is probably not even a good thing. 

Blake Snell is a good pitcher though! But the way the Rays deployed him made him even better. Is he an Ace? No, I don't think so. Is he a top 30 SP in baseball? Yes, I think so. Does the arbitrary title of ""Ace"" even mean anything substantive? No, probably not.

Back to the trade though. The best part of this deal for the Padres is Snell's relative team-friendly contract over the next 3 years (10.5, 12.5, 16). The Rays likely backloaded this deal because they knew his decline was inevitable, and that they would trade him anyways. I think they traded him at the peak of his value. What better time than after his masterful WS performance? Him being a lefty also greatly balances out a Padres rotation that just lost Clevy, and already has an overrated-Paddack, a fragile Lamet, a BABIP-friendly Davies, and an unproven or largely meh remainder of potential starters to choose from.

HOWEVA, the Rays get back the #3, 7, and 14 prospects (MLB.com) from a premiere SD farm system, as well as a very toolsy 25 year old, switch-hitting catcher with MLB experience, who was once a top prospect himself not too long ago. Don't you trust the Rays Player Development system to turn Mejia around? I sure do. He'll be the perfect platoon with Zunino. Heck, with the way pitchers peak and plummet so dramatically these days, Patino could be better than Snell as soon as THIS season! Patino is gushing with talent. Cole Wilcox is yet another behemoth for the Rays to tinker with, who can hit triple digits and has two plus offspeed offerings. Does that fit their specialty or what? Hunt adds to their plethora of catching depth; a position that is notorious for having prospects not pan out, or at least not pan out for long.

And the amazing thing is that Snell is expendable for the Rays! Even with losing him and Uncle Chuck, the Rays still have absurd pitching depth in their rotation and bullpen.

This is exactly the type of strategy, pragmatism, and ideology that keeps the Rays raysin'. You guys will be more than fine. You will thrive for the next decade.

I can only hope something happens between now and spring training that makes me feel better. I want to believe what you said about options is true and not just the FO having to cut costs just for Stu to line his pocket and do nothing else.",2020-12-28,14:55
"Full disclosure I‚Äôm a Padres fan but I saw this on r/baseball and wanted to respond. 

From just a value perspective I think this is a solid deal for the Rays (obviously it‚Äôs bad for baseball that things like this happen, but if you‚Äôre gonna move Snell this is a good return for him), but I feel the need to chime in because I think OP is setting some unrealistic expectations for the return. Patino is a great prospect who has a ton of potential, but this post isn‚Äôt accurately portraying how developed he is. Tbh I doubt he‚Äôll see much of any major league action next year, it was pretty obvious watching the Padres last season that we rushed him up (which we do a lot tbh). His control was really bad last year and his secondaries need some extra development too, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll have too much trouble working his pitches and his control should approach league average as he gets a feel for his entire arsenal. The only thing that worried me about him is his height and that‚Äôs just because he reminds me of Anderson Espinoza (as a short pitcher with a ton of velocity). Mejia, at least imo, is the 4th guy in this trade. He was already starting to show signs of decline when we traded for him and that hasn‚Äôt slowed at all. He‚Äôs not a very good fielder behind the plate so most his value is in his bat which has been dead for the past few years. Wilcox is the prototypical second half of the first round pick, he‚Äôs got electric stuff but he needs to work on making better use of it (he‚Äôs very hittable rn which makes a lot of people think he‚Äôll be a reliever). Hunt is actually the sleeper guy in this trade and I know a lot of Padres fans have been buzzing about him. All around solid catcher and I wouldn‚Äôt be at all surprised to see him be a top 100 or even top 50 prospect this time next year.",2020-12-28,16:22
"It is a good trade but most of the rays fan base right now is overly emotional from his Postseason and World Series performances. 

I keep getting downvoted for saying it‚Äôs a good deal.

"I appreciate this well written breakdown but logic and reason won‚Äôt make me feel better. This is an emotional pain that can‚Äôt be fixed with anything but some combination of time, liquor, beating the Yankees, Zuni Bombs, Lowe Lowe Lowe, and Stu getting everything taken from him by the IRS and the Rays being bought by an eccentric Ybor property developer.",2020-12-28,19:31
"You're right but it is tough to be a Rays fan when this is what we always do. Like...how are we ever going to have any ""Rays legends"" when we don't keep any players? The closest thing we have now is Evan Longoria. Who we let go.

100% agree with you it just stings seeing a core piece like Snell traded with the World Series window wide open. Otherwise on paper this trade is amazing,2020-12-28,17:53
I wish we would just go into win now mode and pick up players so we can win the WS. Getting rid of Snell right now doesn't help us this season. It's like Stu is trying to shut the window that was just opening so we can compete in the future. I would rather go all in and win the World Series and then worry about the team's future later.,2020-12-28,19:26
I don't have a problem with the trade for value reasons. I have a problem with the trade because its part of a bigger issue with management. This would sting ALOT less if we wouldn't have to constantly think about how we might not get back the value we have to trade away for financial of all reasons. The FO turns something into nothing all the time but the biggest cost is usually time for development for when we can be a contender,2020-12-28,17:34
"I agree with everything that you said. I think Snell is getting a bit overrated but I also think that he fits the 3-4 year window that the Padres have right now.

"I think you're right, sold him when his value was high, got some good prospects.  This team has a history of winning these types of trades.  The emotional part of it is tough because this must be the only team in pro sports that even after very successful seasons, the top players are let go or traded.

"If Snell was kept in a couple extra innings and ended up giving up 2 more runs, nobody would say anything, it would just be bad luck. The catastrophic reaction here is more of a product of status quo bias than the wrong-ness of this decision.

For all we know, Morton would have given up a couple extra runs if he was kept in against the Astros. His managerial style is based on making decisions that often feel wrong but, on average, work out better than just instinct. Overall, the strategy works, *and there's no perfect way of predicting when it won't*.

I still lean on this being a bad decision *given the match-up that he was taken out for*, but people are over-reacting so much. Cash brought us to a world series with a roster much worse than other teams at this level.  This sucks, but the odds of winning a world series game with just one run are far lower than the odds of Snell keeping the shut-out for much longer.",2020-10-28,01:14

I don't care that he got us this far. This is a fireable offense.,2020-10-27,23:02

How demoralizing it must be as a player to realize your manager is an absolute dumbass. My heart breaks for me and for them.,2020-10-27,23:36
Cash should be canned for that. Truly stupid.,2020-10-28,01:42
You can't wait till Snell gives up a run to pull him the way our offense has played. Snell hasn't pitched more than 6 innings in over a year and that's not because Cash pulled him too soon. The bullpen got us to this point and Cash trusted them and I don't really blame him. If you wanted Snell to stay in the game you should blame the offense for not giving him more of a cushion.,2020-10-28,04:10

Just want to give our broadcast team a little love, Dwayne is fantastic too but I think we are truly blessed to have the best color commentator, locally or nationally, in the game right now

I‚Äôd love to get an Anderson or staats jersey in the new city connect tbh,2024-05-06,16:46
"I like that Dewayne knows to take a step back and let BA go off when he knows something. It allows Anderson to go in-depth and really explain things beyond a few quips between pitches. 

We can see a ball or strike for ourselves for the most part. Baseball has a pace that allows for more discussion.

ETA: This is also what made me chuckle when Andy Freed first stepped in for Dewayne. You can tell he‚Äôs used to speaking to an audience that can‚Äôt see the game, so he paints an amazing picture packed with detail‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs not essential for TV. He‚Äôs settled in wonderfully, though.",2024-05-06,17:35
"I like BA. He can be long winded and goofy but he has our backs. I think it was last year when our guys were getting plunked a lot and there was a instance of blatant beaning and BA said something to the effect of ""I don't know how much I have left in the tank but I'm ready to suit up and take one for the team"". Dude said he wanted to get some payback live on air. Solid guy in my book.",2024-05-06,17:42

Flap flap, let's fuckin' go! Fuck Stu!",2022-01-20,14:05
"I wonder if there was push from the players union who weren't fond of playing ""home"" games in different countries. I wonder if they gave a concession so that MLB would kill this idea?",2022-01-20,14:57
Don't believe a word Stu says but at least Montreal is off the table,2022-01-20,15:02
Hell yeah!!! I turn 40 tomorrow thank you for this wonderful gift,2022-01-20,12:51
Sailboat stadium confirmed for Al Lang. Give Rowdies Trop Area for MLS stadium. Makes sense,2022-01-20,12:59
This man has a burning desire to get his club out of here. You can hear it in every word that comes out of his mouth. Just a matter of time imo,2022-01-20,13:34
Hot take: MLB saw the cash flowing into Tampa Bay and told Stu to either get a piece of it or GTFO and sell the team,2022-01-20,13:45
The good news? No split city! The bad news? Stu has no plans to sell the team...,2022-01-20,13:59
This is the time for the city to get shit done,2022-01-20,14:03

Stu deserves to be stripped of this franchise. It‚Äôs been since 2005 he knew the Trop is unsustainable. 16 years to make a deal all because he‚Äôs too cheap. Fuck that and fuck him,2022-01-20,15:58

Yes. Especially when the broadcasters were talking about how connected the Dodgers are to the area so there are a ton of fans around in Arizona. We get so much of that with the Yankees and I don‚Äôt wish it in any other team.,2023-10-11,23:08

"This man was called up in the middle of the year, and balled out since he came up. And in an ALDS devoid of good offensive performances, Wander had 2 incredibly clutch homers, and was one of the main reasons the last two games even went to extra innings. It says a lot when a rookie is the most clutch player on a team, and I‚Äôm glad Wander is a Tampa Bay Ray",2021-10-12,11:34
"Oh hell yeah, instant legend. Dude's gonna be a central part of our postseason run every year for the next five years, and probably a future HOFer.

I love him and Randy both, we need to build around them.

Only sad thing about Wander is knowing we probably won't pay him enough to stick around for more than 6 years, and it's already sickening to think of the inevitability of his future in pinstripes at some point.",2021-10-12,13:42

"*He came up in the middle of the year???*

#THIS YEAR?


For a guy who's only played 67 games at the Major League level he's up there playing with the poise of an experienced 27-year-old phenom. Didn't shy away from the spotlight, rose to every occasion, and plays the right way. He, Arozerena, and Lowe are going to pack a serious punch in your lineup and I'm happy for ya'll.",2021-10-12,14:56
"Wander, meadows, randy, and kk are the only ones who showed up in the playoffs. Luplow did well too",2021-10-12,16:12
"Enjoy it while it lasts, cause he ain‚Äôt getting paid here. The saddest realization every year we continue to get bounced.",2021-10-12,11:49
He‚Äôs amazing. I‚Äôm getting his jersey.,2021-10-12,13:32
We won‚Äôt pay him what he‚Äôs worth,2021-10-12,13:25
"He had a look in his eyes after the loss last night. A scary look. The look of ""I'm never letting this happen again."" I think he's talented and he's very driven and could also become a major leader in that clubhouse and will finally be able to legally enjoy the champagne next year.",2021-10-12,15:32
Looking forward to him terrorizing us for years to come,2021-10-12,16:49
He‚Äôs so much fun to watch.,2021-10-12,19:50
Definitely. We need to pick up an older player long term to help him develop his talents.,2021-10-12,22:05
"He understood the assignment, unlike someone who‚Äôs name starts with ‚ÄòBra‚Äô and ends with ‚Äòndon‚Äô",2021-10-12,15:36

"Seemed like every game he was breaking or setting new records. The Rays I know will never pay him what he deserves. Hell, it‚Äôs hard to admit but the way this team was playing post season, we don‚Äôt even fucking deserve Franco.",2021-10-13,10:45
,2020-12-27,23:53
I have never seriously spoken bad about anybody but this man makes my blood boil. I can't believe the MLB lets someone who clearly does not value the team and doesn't even bother to hide it continue to own a team. At some point this bad look needs to be way more publicised so that he becomes a national laughing stock maybe then they'll force him out for PR reasons.,2020-12-28,00:27
This should be top all time,2020-12-28,00:11
"I second that. Great prospects... but we were 2 wins away from a World Series. We don‚Äôt need prospects, we need established players like Snell and Charlie",2020-12-28,00:09

Fuck Stu,2020-12-28,03:20
"Honestly after being so close to winning in the WS this move doesnt make sense now. I get the return being good but the team should have tried to have another go with the core and see what the results were. 

This move seems like its purely for cost savings. MLB and the owners took a hit in revenue because of the shortened season and also not having fans at the games. I feel like $tu decided to cut spending to offset the losses from last year.",2020-12-28,20:19
We won a trade and y‚Äôall mad,2020-12-28,01:02

FUCK STU,2020-12-28,11:05
"Just a Yankees fan coming in here. I know our fanbases hate each other, and I always root against you guys as well. 

But the amount of owners that are straight up not spending is absolutely becoming an issue. So many people have constantly asked if baseball can work in Florida, but the MLB is actively sabotaging themselves in the state by allowing Stu and owners like Loria to stay for so long. There is no longevity and many casual fans just find it hard to ever root for any long time player",2020-12-28,23:58
"He interacted, smiled, gave thumbs ups and threw balls to the fans even in the 8th and 9th innings.  After the game, he came back out to thank the fans.

"Yeah, I was right behind the dugout when he came out and clapped at the fans after the game. It actually made me tear up. Loved him seeing our support and appreciating it when it felt like the rest of the baseball world was shitting all over the fan base and the team.

I understand wanting to run back to the showers and get out of there. But we know Randy wanted to win as much or more than anyone, and there he was.",2023-10-05,08:47
He deserves Wander's pay if Wander doesn't come back. Hell he deserves it even if he does come back,2023-10-05,09:23
Yandy is really really good with the fans as well. We got a good team of players that appreciate the fans,2023-10-06,11:59

"I‚Äôm a long-time baseball fan, but my three daughters (ages 13 and below) have only had a mild interest in baseball. This winter I decided this would be the year I got them into baseball. I started talking about the season before spring training, and then we watched a few spring training games. Then we made a big deal out of Opening Day and have watched at least part of every game this year.

The problem? I think my daughters are starting to believe that it‚Äôs the Rays‚Äô divine right to score 6+ runs every game. They believe in magical beings named Shane and Wander and Yandy and Randy and Brandon who can do no wrong. They think an angelic figure named Kevin Cash descended from the heavens for the purpose of managing a 162-0 baseball team. They suspect that Dewayne Staats might be the Voice of God.

In short, I accuse the Tampa Bay Rays of corrupting our youth, and I‚Äôm here for it.",2023-04-14,11:07

You can hate Stu all you want but for decades the city of st Pete waved the lease around to keep the team from getting a deal done anywhere.

Hell they even scaled back the insurance to screw it even more then the dickheads at the county commission decided to go back on their word and then everybody got cold feet.  I‚Äôm not discounting the possibility that the rays are overstating the cost of the overruns but with the cut in revenue from Steinbrenner and the politicians dragging their feet enough to add an extra year to construction you could be looking at upwards of an extra quarter billion.  Nobody has that.,2024-11-21,20:33

It was bad enough they let Randy go - man had a smile and rizz teams are built on. And the wander Franco fiasco- I was present for his debut in the major league - a game where he hit a 3 run dinger. I know the stadium is like the inside of an air conditioner-but it had flappy bois and a weird tunnel that is disproportionately ominous. I grew up a Red Sox fan. I of course could not root for them after they let Mookie Betts go. This is so wrong. How was there not a plan for this? And they just let the flappy bois stay there during Milton? I‚Äôm so mad.

"Stu has been trying to move this team since he acquired them.  See: Plan, Montreal.  That plan was in place for over a decade and the original person who reported it was clowned so hard that he stopped writing about the team.  I hate admitting Cork Gaines was right because he's such an asshole.  

Always building competitive teams on the cheap but never actually committing to winning by bringing in the one or two extra pieces they'd always end up needing.  Signing players to team friendly deals then trading the talented ones away for cheap prospects while being stuck overpaying the ones that failed to meet their full potential.  Complaining about a dreaded $100 million dollar payroll last year as if it's still a lot of money in this league when 25 teams last season had $100 million dollar payrolls or higher.

Let this team walk.  Baseball is a dying sport and St. Petersburg is a thriving city.  They don't need each other, and a baseball stadium needs to be located in either Tampa, or if on the Pinellas side, further north in the county where all of the bridges come together.  Not in the southern part of the county where a trip to a game is a 5 hour endeavor for anyone north of Ulmerton or on the other side of the Skyway.",2024-11-22,08:09

" Hello and welcome to the Rays subreddit, I am your friendly /r/TampaBayRays Moderator and heart-throb /u/RyeWhiskeyy. Allow me to be your guide on the epic journey that is Rays Baseball.

As some of you may or may not have known, The Rays have been playing professional baseball since the late 1900's. They are Located in St. Petersburg Fla, ( I know, I know, But St.Pete is in the Tampa Bay Area, so close enough, right?) a historic baseball community. They are owned by Stu Sternberg, a Wall street investor. Leading the front office are Matt Silverman and Eric Neander. With Coach Kevin Cash managing on the field.


For a guide to the previous 2018 season [read my toast from Toast from the baseball subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/al9yzo/a_toast_to_the_tampa_bay_rays/?) /r/Baseball, That is also a great sub if you haven't already.

Have a look at our [roster](http://m.rays.mlb.com/roster/) and familiarize yourself with some of our team. Some sub favorites are Tommy Pham, ji-Man Choi, Tyler Glasnow, Austin Meadows and Brandon Lower.

Now baseball is a game played between two teams of 9 players, When the offensive team comes up to bat, They have 3 chances or "" Outs"" to move players on to base and down the baseline.  They can reach base by getting a hit, getting walked ( When a pitcher throws 4 garbage pitches that the hitter doesn't swing at also known as ""Balls"") getting hit by a pitch, balk and there are a few others I guess but these are the important ones. Each individual batter can swing at the ball until they have either accumulated 3 swings that did not hit anything called "" strikes""or 4 balls, as we previously discussed. At this point, they are either get a hit, are out or take 1st base. Each team gets three outs per inning, and there are 9 innings, so be prepared to watch a game for at a minimum of at least 5 or 6 hours.

Now the defenses job is to Pitch the ball , that guys job is to throw nasty pitches, in the strike zone, or Umpires zone of bullshit, to strike out the other team. If the ball is hit into play, Its up to the fielders to field the ball and assist with getting the out by either catching the ball or throwing the ball to whatever base a offensive player is running too. Multiple outs can be gotten in a single play.

Anyways, that's enough explaining baseball to you, I know it seems complicated, but its not and you will understand it soon enough.  

Now the Rays play at a historic field named for a wonderful juice brand called Tropicana. You Lightning fans may know it as it was once home your hockey team. Well, a lot has changed since then and I can guarantee that there probably isn't any ice on the field anymore. Now, a lot of people like to talk shit about the Trop, They say its ugly and disgrace to baseball, so In that instance Rule number 1 is always Defend the Trop, I don't care if you hate it, It's ours and you are going to fucking like it. If any silly Yankees fan talks shit about the Trop and brags about the 27 rings their team won 2,000 years ago, tell them to shove it. Literally shove the Trop up there ass, Its spherical so it shouldn't be to hard.

So why should you bandwagon the Rays and not some other loser ass team? Well, The Rays are simply different. If you didn't know, The Rays have one of the lowest payrolls in baseball, they rely on atypical strategies like Openers, bullpenning, defensive shifts etc that baseball traditionalist hate. But fuck them. Not only are the Rays not afraid to try new things, but they are also fairly successful at it. After using these strategies to take a team predicted to win 60-ish games to competing for wild card spot, many people are looking at baseball differently as the Rays are at the forefront of baseball innovation. Gone are the days or peanuts and crackerjacks and getting sucked off underneath the right field bleachers. Today is about pulled pork nachos, petting stingrays in left field and Blake Snell streaming fortnite for some reason. You guys are privileged to  watch history in the making and by privileged I mean getting to watch Ryne Stanek (Crack Thor) get 30 game starts with only 50 innings pitched. 

I hope by now you guys have realized this post is a joke, so welcome to the subreddit and please don't forget to join our discord https://discord.gg/fNKTfgj and as always, Defend the Trop. I swear to god you need to physically threaten people if they talk shit about the Trop.",2019-04-17,09:45
"You mentioned a balk, but didn't explain what it is. Which can be frustrating to new fans because it's not very self-evident, so I figured I'd post the official balk rules for people new to baseball.

# Balk Rules

1. You can't just be up there and just doin' a balk like that.

1a. A balk is when you

1b. Okay well listen. A balk is when you balk the

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The pitcher is not allowed to do a motion to the, uh, batter, that prohibits the batter from doing, you know, just trying to hit the ball. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the pitcher is in the stretch, he can't be over here and say to the runner, like, ""I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna tag you out! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to pitch and then don't pitch, you have to still pitch. You cannot not pitch. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, throwing motion of the ball, and then, until you just throw it.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have the ball up here, like this, but then there's the balk you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. Fairuza Balk hasn't been in any movies in forever. I hope she wasn't typecast as that racist lady in American History X.

1c-b(2)-b(i). Oh wait, she was in The Waterboy too! That would be even worse.

1c-b(2)-b(ii). ""get in mah bellah"" -- Adam Water, ""The Waterboy."" Haha, classic...

1c-b(3). Okay seriously though. A balk is when the pitcher makes a movement that, as determined by, when you do a move involving the baseball and field of

"Waaaaaaayyyyyyy back when...

Johnny Damon still played for the Sox. I worked at the hotel where all the visiting teams stayed. Some of the guys are laughing it up about whatever party they threw the night before. Today was just  a travel day, so they partied hard. Standing out front, enjoying some sun and Damon comes out and joins them.

Meanwhile, over on the side of the stairs where they are standing, a groundskeeper is picking up palm fronds, sticks, etc...

He has those long grabbers that make picking up trash easier when reaching thru the bushes. He pulls out, what I can only assume is a party favor from the Sox shindig. A dildo as big as my arm. The way the group reacts to it, i can only assume Damon is responsible for it.
