I don't know if you'll ever see an athlete do what Papi did in 2004 2007 2013 for a franchise, nation of a fan base, and the city of Boston.

"I didn't grow up a Red Sox fan. Baseball was never really watched in my household, and if anything my dad was a O's fan. 2003 brought me into the fold by bringing all of New England close to the brink and then getting crushed. But that excitement... I was hooked. 2004 and all its majesty was the first full season I paid attention to the Red Sox, and from that moment forward I've been a die-hard Sox fan. 

One man was the glue the held it all together, the single most clutch hitter I will likely ever see, a man who not only brought the Sox their first win in 86 years but was a (if not -the-) cog in bringing home two more, the man who even as far back as AOL Instant Messenger was my favorite player as immortalized by the original nickname PapiPedroManny. Big Papi. The Large Father. David Ortiz.

One day when I'm old and grey I will regale my Sox loving grandchildren with stories of how the legend truly doesn't capture the man. How there was simply something different in the air when he came up to bat with the game on the line. How I got to see Ortiz live. How I got see Papi hit a home run. How when it came down to it, Papi always somehow had the well the never ran out to go to when the team needed him most. 

And I won't be alone. David was every kid who grew up with the Red Sox in the past decade's favorite player. It was practically a requirement. The Red Sox will move on. Even now with this loss they're in one of the best positions in baseball moving forward over the next five years, and look to build on this success with more from the core next year. But it won't be the same. Everything is different now.

The use of the word 'era' is one of the most overused terms in sports. If a player has a couple good years somewhere than leaves, it's inevitably the end of that guys era. But here, now, it's more than apropos. The David Ortiz Era has ended. The Era of The Idiots has ended. The team that brought the Red Sox back to World Series glory is now all gone. My childhood baseball team, my first team... it's over. I know now, even at 23, that nothing as special as these past dozen years of the David Ortiz Era will ever come to pass. Not for me.

So as one tiny Sox fan in a sea of Red, thank you Mr. Ortiz. You were, everything boiled down, the reason I became the baseball fan I am today. And that is a gift I can never repay. ",2016-10-10,22:28,['361010102']

"Well, what else is there to say. Truly a shame that this team got swept. So much young talent and a helluva regular season. This team will be good for the next 4 or 5 years and probably make the playoffs those years with the core that we have in the lineup. 


End of an era. The last remnant of 2004 moves on. It's truly a feat in sports these days to see a big time athlete stick around for 13 years with one team and have the impact Ortiz has had on a team and a city. He picked us up in 2004 when the anxiety and ""here we go again"" hopelessness was at a fever pitch with the Yankees still riding the wave of the 90s success. Then 9 years later he picked up a city again exclaiming ""this is our fuckin city"" at a time when sports transcended real life tragedy. He didn't just change the expectations of a fan base, he changed the entire attitude of a region. Transformed the label of lovable losers into force to be reckoned with and perennial pennant threat. 


It's cliche to say things like ""a once in a generation athlete/player,"" but in Ortiz's case it could not be more appropriate. There will likely never be another curse or another 86 year period of toil. The team has been elevated. Guys want to play for the Boston fans now instead of holding disdain toward them like in the late 80s and early 90s. His demeanor and smile transferred to the city and fan base. It's something that is very rarely seen in modern sports where an athlete takes the time to devote himself to a city and region. I'm sure he'll have a role to play with the Red Sox in some form or another whether it be a bench coach or hitting coach in a few years, but for now, I can't help but shed a tear or two. No single player ever has and probably ever will make me feel as high as watching David Ortiz play baseball did.


His stats don't tell his story. In four years when he's eligible for the Hall, he'll be picked apart stat by stat and lazily compared to Edgar Martinez by talking heads who have probably never attended a game at Fenway to see the crowd react to Papi coming to the plate. Stats do not and cannot account for everything Ortiz did in 13 years in Boston. Stats don't exist for coming up to the plate in the late innings down by a run or two yet feeling like the game is still well in hand because Papi is on deck with a runner on. He had a better career in 13 years in Boston than most players have in 18 or 20 years.


While it's the end of an era in Boston, he leaves the team in good hands. It's important that we got a season of success with Mookie, Anthony, JBJ, and all the other young bucks to learn from one of the greatest. He'll never be forgotten, but damn, for the near future, that 3 spot will feel empty without the big guy coming up to the plate. Rest those aching feet Papi, you don't have to carry the city on your back anymore.",2016-10-10,22:46,['361010102']

"I remember being in high school in the Dominican Republic for my senior year when the '04 October happened.

I don't know if you guys know this, but in the Dominican there were no Red Sox fans in the 90s. It was all Yankees, but Pedro and Papi changed that forever.

I remember that ALCS. I remember all the Yankee fans at school giving me shit all day after game 3. I remember the papers saying we were done.

I remember game 4, but most of all I remember game 5. God, I loved that headline. It said ""THE YANKEES' BIG FATHER"" in Spanish, and the photo of David rounding first after that game winning hit in the 14th inning. It was awesome after hearing Pedro call the Yankees his daddy, and all the bullshit that came of that, have David be called the Yankees' daddy all by himself. 

I remember '07. It cemented the idea that the curse was really over. That '04 wasn't a fluke. That we could win championships for real, and often.

Then there's 2013. Man, what can I say about that? The island literally stopped to watch Big Papi fucking crush that postseason. Nobody missed 1 second of 1 game.

I recall watching that ALCS grand slam at my father's house. Bases loaded... ""what if he hits a homer now? Could you imagine? That'd be crazy."" And BOOM! TIE GAME!

I remember running into him at the gym every off season. The man worked out every day like he had some baseball to play in December. We were doing bench press right next to each other once, and he said hi to me like we'd been friends for years ""Que lo que mi hermano?"", smiled and hugged me. If you wanna call him a celebrity, he's the nicest one on the planet, by far.

I ran into him on the elevator once before that, and I asked him why he worked out so hard in December, and he said it's the only way to stay in shape for March. ""Old guys don't have the luxury of vacations"" 

I hope I run into him again when I'm down there for Christmas. Part of me finds solace in the fact that I'll get to see him from time to time, but I'm mostly sad that we won't be seeing him walk up to the plate and put on that beautiful show.

We'll miss you, big man. Thanks for the memories. We'll cherish them forever.

I guess this is baseball though, we've had a lot of our romantic moments in the years Ortiz was here, I guess we weren't meant to have a fairy tale ending for him even with him putting up one of the best seasons in his career. Fuck the ending though, his career with us was pretty much a fairytale, and in the end we won't remember this ending, we'll remember the ending to those 3 world series he helped bring us after 86 fucking years.",2016-10-11,01:31,[]
"I'm not a Red Sox fan but I was stationed in Boston in 2013 during their World Series run and worked security during the parade while they were doing their lap in the Charles on the duck boats.  Papi was the coolest most down to earth guy, constantly pointing at us in a celebratory way and getting people to cheer for us as we went by.  I eventually got to shake his hand and take a few pics -- he is a real class act.",2016-10-11,03:28,[]
"David Ortiz changed my life and I'll always carry him with me. I grew up as an American expat in New Delhi,  India and clung fiercely to baseball and the few Nickelodeon VHS tapes my parents brought over. For a while, baseball and pop culture were really the only ties to my American identity beyond my parents. Outside of occasional games on summer road trips through the US, I didn't have the chance to watch or truly follow a Major League Baseball team until ESPN Star Sports started airing NESN and YES games at 530 in the morning. For a kid, the Idiots were a fun, easy choice over the stoic Yankees. The 2003 postseason broke my heart, but cemented my status as a Red Sox fan for life. After FINALLY making it to my first Red Sox game in 2007, I knew I was home. Papi and Manny each homered. The air was so thick with excitement and energy, you knew the ball was bound to hang up in the zone. 

Thanks to Large Father, I applied only to schools in  Boston, was lucky enough to live across the Pike on Newbury Street so I could wake up to Fenway every morning and felt like I had been a Bostonian all my life, soaking in the game day buzz from my porch. I even went to more than 50 games during the Bobby Valentine train wreck just to watch Papi react to every little change in the game. 

Thanks to Papi, I picked a great University that helped my startup grow semi pro and youth baseball in India. Seeing what baseball did for him keeps me going every day. His energy and joy for baseball has been in my bones since I used to get up for games every morning, too thrilled to be sleepy. There's talent in India. There's unbridled love for baseball in players here. I know that if Papi could have gone from a kid who just wanted to have fun to Boston's favorite son, so could so many of the wonderful Indian kids I see take the field every day. 

I cried like a baby in front of my players watching Marco come in for Ortiz during our morning practice yesterday. When I looked up, however, I couldn't help but smile. I saw more than 30 Indian teens, some gutted at the red sox loss, some in my face gloating that we won't have the AL's best offense anymore, and others still  talking about the Nats chances and how they think the hot stove season will play out. If it weren't for David Ortiz, I may have never held onto that passion for baseball and we may have never started our pipe dream baseball league here. No matter whether we develop India's first major leagues or simply maintain a fun youth league, I feel so moved that a single player with a booming voice, wide smile and deadly bat could change so many lives 8000 miles from Fenway. 

I love you David. Thank you for everything you've done and will continue to do to keep the love and joy in baseball.",2016-10-12,07:21,[]

"One of my favorite memories in baseball was being in 7th grade I had morning detention for a few weeks during the 2004 run. Even though I was in trouble, my dad let me stay up to watch the Sox come back, and saw all of Papi's clutch hits. I'd go into detention the next day and my teachers and I would talk about how incredible he was. Keep in mind he's always terrorized my tigers, to me he's the most clutch player in any sport. Nobody will come close to what he accomplished.",2016-10-10,22:00,['361010102']

I am so thankful for all of the clutch hits, the pep talks, the energy he brought every day, and the never quit feeling he brought to this fan base.

"He is my favorite athlete of all time. I will always be glad that I got to watch him play for so long. I first got into baseball, and the Sox, during the 2001 season, when I was 9. Those early 2000s teams were the foundation of my appreciation for this sport, and my memories of those early days with Ortiz and Manny crushing everything are still strong. 2004 is and always will be my most cherished sports memory, and Papi is always the first person who comes to mind. It would have been enough if that was all he ever did, but it wasn't. My favorite thing about this season was watching the *fear* opposing pitchers had on the mound when he was at the plate. No one ever wanted to pitch to him, at age 40. 

I am not so much upset that the Sox lost as I am that Papi lost. This team is great and only going to get better in the years to come. There will be plenty of chances for them to win another title. They'll just be doing it without my favorite player.",2016-10-10,22:04,['361010102']

"In 2002 I was given a hat with a letter B on it.  I was a Mets fan at the time but I was also 9 and decided that this hat would be my newest favorite team.  I started watching the Red Sox, and there were two players that stood out to me, Manny and Papi.  Growing up in NC I had no real connection to Boston or the Red Sox, except through David Ortiz.  The man played with so much poise, power, and respect.  I've followed through the ups and downs since then and have been blessed to see 3 championships, and witness one game (in ATL) that Papi hit a home run in, a few sections away from me.  I was ecstatic that I witnessed my favorite player hit a homer in in person.  Over the years, Papi has given me a reason to watch, gave me an emotional connection to a team I just happened to choose to like based on a hat, and damn have I loved the last 14 years as a Red Sox fan, especially when the Bullpen Cop homer happened and you helped the city be #BostonStrong.  Thanks for the memories Papi, you have made me one proud Red Sox fan.",2016-10-10,22:16,['361010102']

"Every single time he got up to that fucking plate of his career it was like the whole stadium was ready for him to hit a homerun, that's how clutch he was as a hitter. Not just that but he was so  funny, he didn't give a fuck what anyone thought, he smashed a fucking telephone at another teams ballpark, he said fuck on  television, and at every opportunity he was the leader and even tonight he got his team going.

"When I was around ten, my dad got tickets for the Red Sox when they came to Anaheim. We got there right when the gates opened, and I immediately ran down to the Red Sox dugout. For whatever reason, Papi was in the stands right in the first row. Being a little kid, I shoved my way into the front of the circle that formed around him as he talked with fans. Did I ever say a word to him? Of course not I was too scared. But I still remember just being in his presence, just knowing I was there by him. I was a little kid then, and now I've felt like I've grown up. ",2016-10-10,22:20,['361010102']

HIS FLAIR SHALL NEVER FADE,2016-10-10,22:23,['361010102']
"I was 11 years old when the Red Sox signed David Ortiz. That year, I remember advocating that Jeremy Giambi should be the DH after a decent spring training. 13 years, three World Series wins, and countless memories later, it's time to say goodbye.

I write little elegies for retired sports folk a few times a year, but this one is the hardest yet. Without Big Papi, probably my greatest memory in life wouldn't exist. David Ortiz wasn't just an athlete. His words lifted me up when I could barely conceive happiness - (""This is our fucking city""). His smile, belief, and passion made every summer just a bit better. His story made me think that I could achieve anything if I worked hard enough. His dedication to not just the game, but to the community was enough to save lives.
It's stupid to feel so sad that you can't watch a millionaire play a relatively meaningless sport ever again, I get it. But to me, Big Papi feels like a friend. He feels like that guy that was there for you when you needed it the most, and without him, baseball can never be the same to me.

Thank you, Papi. In my most honest and sincere belief, thank you for everything. I don't think you could ever understand how much you'll be missed. Like I asked my relatives for stories about seeing Ted Williams play, I know I'll be telling stories of seeing you play for the rest of my life. You are truly one of the greats.

See you all next Spring. Go Sox.",2016-10-10,22:26,['361010102']

"Alright I did some quick math on baseball-reference. I tallied the career bWAR to date of every player taken in rounds 2-5 in the 2011 draft except for Mookie Betts.

That's 52 Major League players, 48 of whom were drafted before Mookie. The combined career WAR of these 52 players as of right now is **32.2.**

Mookie Betts has amassed **35.2** career WAR. Per my calculations, **35.2** &gt; **32.2**. Mookie Betts is worth more than two full teams-worth of Major League Baseball players, don't look into that, it's verifiable and I have the numbers to prove it so let's just move on.

It's even better when we restrict it to just the 5th round: compared to Mookie's 35.2, the rest of that 5th round draft class has produced 3.1 career war. Combined. Mookie's accumulated more than 10x as much WAR as every other player taken in that round put together.

And, for what it's worth, the most valuable player taken in the 1st round by WAR that year is currently Francisco Lindor at 23.9. He's a fantastic baseball player too.",2018-11-16,00:54,[]

"Excuse the throwaway (for anonymity), but I promise you what I'm about to say is a true first-hand account of my experience with Jack. I grew up playing against him, and then played with him in college. I've been extremely proud of what he's accomplished in his career, but I can't say I'm surprised.

Personal anecdote first, I grew up playing baseball year round, and managed to find myself on a damn good travel ball team between 13 and 15 years old. This isn't to brag, or anything, just to give you an idea that we didn't mess around, played some good ball, and weren't too easy to impress. We won a lot of tournaments. We had a lot of good players. 5 of us went on to play D-1 college ball. We had a great rivalry with a team named the Tidewater Drillers, out of Virginia, and got the better of them more than they got us. The Tidewater Drillers ""alumni"" includes Mark Reynolds, Chris Taylor, David Winfree, and Ryan Zimmerman. I played against Taylor, but I don't remember him the way I remember Jackie.

In my 2-3 years on this team, we didn't get beat often, however, we were run-ruled just one time, by the Richmond Braves. This team was a bunch of donkeys. Obviously, in teenage years, some kids grow faster than others, and in sports, that advantage can be huge. We had four or five of those. The Braves had 12. Except for one small black kid they put in centerfield. We figured he must be pretty good to be on this team, but he looked tiny next to his teammates. He's hitting lead off, and starts the game off by smacking a line-drive double to the warning track. This went on the entire game, and yes, we did get to see his arm from center. We got their big sticks out a few times, and handled the lineup pretty well. Except this CFer. He went 5-5 against us, with 3 or 4 doubles, and was hitting piss missiles every time. But this is what impressed me the most. This kid's running around the bases damn near every inning, he's chasing balls all over the outfield, and any time he wasn't doing that, he was outside the dugout, taking swings off a tee into a net. The entire game. Different drills. Different swings. Hitting to all fields. He was perfecting his craft in the middle of a game, at 14 years old. To this day, he's the only person I've seen do that. We ended up losing that game 10-0, which had never happened to us, and we couldn't even be mad about it. They all whooped our ass, but we were just amazed by that little CFer, more than anything else.

Fast forward a few years, and I was a walk-on at the University of South Carolina. I meet Jackie, and we get to talking. I knew he was from around my area, so I started asking him where he played, and came to realize, he was that CFer from all those years ago. And he hadn't changed. In that locker room, there were walk-ons like me that knew this was the last stop before beer league. There were guys with god-given ability that wasted it. There were guys you'd watch and think they've got a chance to make it to the show (Whit Merrifield, for one). And then there was JBJ. It was transcendent with him. He was going to make it to the Bigs. You could just tell by the way he played. The way he worked. The way he spoke. He was humble, hard-working, and quiet. Yet he still had this major league vibe about him, and you could feel that this just going to be a chapter to a very long career. He's a class act and a great personality, with great parents who came to every single weekend series. Off the field, he'd occasionally DD friends, but I don't think I ever saw him take a sip of alcohol. That had to have been hard to do with that team, in particular, and an SEC environment. He was a true professional from the very beginning.

On top of his approach to the game, his two national titles, CWS MOP, and his hitting, he has a fucking Howitzer attached to his torso, and he is far and away the best defensive centerfielder I've ever seen. He was going to the Show on his defense alone. He could hit .150 and he'd still be a tremendous late game replacement. I got to see it every day. I played a bit of corner outfield, but center is tough. Jackie knows where the ball is going to be as soon as it hits the bat. I've watched him do it thousands of times, and I can count on one hand how many times I've seen him misjudge a ball. I still don't know how he does it with that straight-on angle. His instincts are supernatural.

Anyways, to wrap this up, I've been so proud of him over the years, but this series was something else. From what I've seen out of Boston fans, you guys accept his hitting for what it is because of how damn good he is out there in the toughest outfield in baseball. I appreciate the love y'all have for him, and just wanted to share my personal experience as an insight to who Jackie is, and that he deserves to be ballin. He's always been a big-stage player, and I've been jumping out of my seat watching him this week. I'm rooting for y'all to win this shit. Go Sox!

"His slumps are hard to take, for sure. But if you look at the advanced stats, you see that he's been pretty damn unlucky at the plate this year, and obviously kills it in the field. He's a great teammate, works hard, and is a damn golden boy when he's interviewed. 

All those intangibles, mighty fine defense, and the occasional streak of a power bat... I think he's earned his $6M salary. Let's hope he can carry his success in this series to the biggest stage there is.

Thanks for your story!",2018-10-19,10:04,"['381018118', 381018118]"

"I have friends who grew up playing ball with Jackie. I have friends who graduated with Jackie and know his wife very well. Guy is an all around class act. One of the better parts about your story is the part about his professionalism at a young age. Another local kid was drafted by the Red Sox organization and never could pan out. It was partially skill but constantly being held down because of drug use. And in an area where Jackie is from drugs have become rampant. It‚Äôs great to see the success of Jackie.

I had a couple buddies who I played travel ball with who ended up playing for the Richmond Braves and that organization is incredible. I'm pretty sure most of their roster went D1 and I know a couple who got drafted from their team (Devon Fisher who is in the sox system now). I think they were on the team when JBJ was at South Carolina and killing it in the CWS and they all had nothing but great things to say about him.,2018-10-19,13:38,"['381018118', 381018118]"

 As we all have see what he does in the outfield makes up for his slumps at bat but he's here to stay (MLB) you don't hit .170+ for a month and stay up in most clubs (Exp Chris Davis) but there's no way you send this kid away with what he brings to the OF

"I don't doubt compared to talent in a youth league a guy like JBJ seems transcendent. At the MLB level, he isn't an elite hitter but every MLB player was no doubt dominant at lower levels.

I don't say that to criticize JBJ. He is a defensive player first. And he may be the best defensive Center Fielder in the entire world. So he has nothing to be ashamed of when he is streaky and can't hit for a while.

But I absolutely believe his anecdote about him being humble even back then. JBJ has always come across as a very even-keel guy who doesn't get emotional when he is struggling or succeeding. He just always puts his head down and gets to work, no matter the situation.

JBJ hit .400 in this series if I recall. No one should expect to see JBJ hit .400 next year. I doubt he'll hit .300 next year. But I'm really glad he got his moment in the sun.",2018-10-19,13:10,"['381018118', 381018118]"

"HOUSTON (AP) -- Researchers in Houston today announced a shocking discovery that has upended the scientific world. They say they have collected conclusive evidence that 13-year old Rafael Devers is the biological father of 36-year old Justin Verlander.

""This discovery upends everything we know about not only human biology but also the linear nature of time,"" said Solo Johnson, one of the researchers on the team that announced the discovery. ""But the data we have collected allows for no other conclusion.""

Researchers say they first became suspicious of Verlander's true paternity in October 2018 when Devers ""totally dad dicked"" Verlander in the ALCS. But their sample size at the time was too small to pass scientific muster.

Now they report further testing has confirmed their prior findings.

""After observing the young third baseman again assert his fatherly dominance at Verlander's own park, we can now say with 100 percent scientific certainty that Rafael Devers is Justin Verlander's biological father.""

Although earlier findings drew skeptics from across the scientific community, the researchers' latest findings have produced wide-spread consensus.

""At first I said, 'Are you kidding me?'"" recounted Stat Masterson, chair of the Bridgepiece Studies Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""But now it's a beautiful thing. I'm telling ya.""

Scientists from around the world report that they expect another opportunity to observe the unusual father-son duo in their natural habitat this fall.",2019-05-26,18:36,"[401075513, '401075513']"

* We found Kyle from Waltham.
* We came back down 4 against the Yankees when we were getting no hit.
* We eliminated the Yankees.
* We eliminated the Rays.
* We won 92 games in a division where 4 teams won 90 games or more.
* We saved our farm system instead of mortgaging it for one season like in 2018.
* We have Marcelo Maier.
* Garrett Whitlock and Tanner Houck will be in the rotation next year.
* Nate Eovaldi became an ace.
* We set records for Grand Slams in the playoffs.
* We had the most comeback wins in the league.
* We got through the last 2 months without a closer.
* The crowds at Fenway this year, especially in the playoffs, were absolutely insane.

I don't need to go into detail about the rotation, especially since Sale could be out until any point between May and August. Eduardo Rodriguez is a slightly above average pitcher when healthy, but that's about it.

The bullpen? Matt Barnes isn't that good, and Ottaviano cannot flourish in high-leverage situations or tight games. The rest of their bullpen is makeshift.

"I feel like the Sox strongly outperformed my expectations this regular season. After last year's 24-36 (.400 win %) fiasco, I hoped they could rebound to be a 500 ball club. Best case scenario, I saw 85 wins, which would have been a 20 win improvement if you project 2020 to a full 162 game season. 20 win improvements are super rare.

This year's team found ways to win a lot of games that appeared lost in the late innings. Of course the bullpen or lack of clutch hitting or bonehead base running led to a few late losses, but over 162 games all teams are going to deal with some of that.

Offensively, I had more hope than the OP. I felt Martinez was going to have a solid bounce back year. Without that, 500 ball isn't going to happen. Devers/Bogaerts, given where they are in their careers I think you can expect something in the very good to excellent range offensively under pretty much any scenario you can draw up. I've liked Verdugo since day 1 with the club. I think he's just developing into the kind of player he can be. 2020 was really his first year as an everyday player. That's the kind of player who can go either way - improve into a core part of the lineup or regress as the league figures out how to beat him. Solid progress.

Coming into the season I would have rated Renfroe higher than the OP seems to. He'd really only had 1 very good season in his career so far, 2018, but stepped up big time in an everyday role. I thought he'd be more of a platoon player. Had no idea how good he can be in RF.

Kike Hernandez and Christian Arroyo, I'd say both exceeded my expectations. They both came in as solid major leaguers. But so did Marwin Golzalez and Franchy Cordero (more limited sample size there). Win some, lost some...

Vazquez, I expected a better season offensively. 2019 and 2020 were solid. 23 HRs in 2019, 7 in essentially 1/3 of a full season last year. he ended up with an OB% that was pretty much a career low, and a Slugging % down over 100 points compared to the last 2 years. Sadly, he's kind of the JB Jr spot in the lineup now, albeit with a a little better OB% and worse power numbers. I'd have liked to have see Plawecki in more often.

Dalbec, didn't expect much out of him one way or the other, too raw a player to have a feel for what you can expect going into this season. Overall I think the Sox got solid production out of him.

Going into the season, based on what I wrote above, I felt they had made some potentially good offensive upgrades from the 2020 team, but they needed some bounces to go their way.",2021-10-04,15:18,[]

It makes us look bad.  Focus on the positives, be happy we‚Äôre not the Orioles.

Obviously the team isn‚Äôt perfect but who is?  Y‚Äôall decided a month ago that we weren‚Äôt going to make the playoffs and we still did despite your endless whining so who‚Äôs to say we won‚Äôt win again?

Top 5 Red Sox pitchers you would expect to throw at someone in retaliation:
5. Heath Hembree - Would be higher if he still looked like kenny powers
4. Erod - Threw at Machado, little more tame than throwing at his head
3. Chris Sale - Those jerseys didn't cut themselves, he dgaf if he's the best player
2. Matt Barnes - Threw at Machado's head, bit of over kill
1. Joe F'in Kelly - You can't great about him coming into a tie game, but you know he's gonna throw at someone if he has to

"5 IP, 2 H, 1 R.

I don‚Äôt care that we scored 14 runs, if he gives up another 3-4 and struggles through a few innings the whole dynamic of the game is different. We literally had Matt Barnes warming up in the 1st inning to relieve Sale if he couldn‚Äôt get 3 outs.

"A lot of Sox fans are really soft now. Maybe it‚Äôs just Reddit? Honestly. 

I mean I think this is probably going to get me flak based on that other thread but I also do not understand the viciousness about some of them not being vaccinated. I‚Äôm a vaccinated person and I find the outrage pretty comical honestly. If them being a cross section of our country (I mean seriously it‚Äôs not just that unvaccinated people are selfish or dumb or whatever name you wanna call them this country has a lot of issues and frankly if you look at it objectively it makes sense some are paranoid and skeptical especially in certain communities like black communities, Latin communities, and poor people) is such an issue idk how these people watch games and root for these guys at all. Pro athletes have long had really bad, at times harmful opinions about things. 

If that‚Äôs going to stop you from rooting for your favorite baseball or have you say you hate JD Martinez idk. It seems wack. And to me it‚Äôs a similar phenomenon to the revisionist history about Machado. I‚Äôm pretty used to my favorite ballplayers not sharing my politics.

"Given how close the race for the AL East is this year, I find myself constantly checking the latest scores for the Yankees every time I am on the At Bat app, hoping they lose.

In this past month, I've noticed that whenever I check their score and find them in a losing position, they always manage to rally and win the game! This happened multiple times with the Mets, Nationals, etc., but the final straw was the 5-0 lead Seattle blew last week.

I promised myself that I wouldn't check the score of their game even one single time, and the result is there for all of you to see! SWEEP!!! Needless to say, I won't be checking another Yankee score for the rest of the season.

Here's hoping this bad juju continues and they slump so hard that they struggle to make it to the 2nd wild card spot.

"Came here to say this exact thing. I thought we were gonna be fourth in the division at the start of the season, and during the hot start my brother and I said to each other again and again ‚Äúa wild card chase would be great but I‚Äôve got no expectations.‚Äù 


Well not only did we get the wild card chase, we got to send the Yankees home. What was supposed to be a rebuild has surpassed my wildest expectations. Everything from here on out is icing on the cake.",2021-10-06,10:23,"[401361933, '401361933']"

It‚Äôs not 1978, but it helps.  

That said, I‚Äôm not satisfied. I want more.  Bring on the Rays!  We aren‚Äôt expected to beat them, which is exactly how we will do it.",2021-10-06,12:06,"[401361933, '401361933']"

"Alex Cora took a 65 win team (going off last year‚Äôs win%) and turned us into a 92 win team that had home field advantage against the Yankees. All projections had us in the 78-82 win range, 4th in the division and definitely not in the playoffs.

I‚Äôll still be upset if we lose to the Rays, but this season has been an overwhelming success and we did the next best thing to winning the WS‚Äîwe knocked out the Yankees",2021-10-06,18:12,"[401361933, '401361933']"

"I didn't understand and I still do not understand why the Yankees were ranked so high before the season in all that predictions. I mean, look at their offensive numbers this season (yesterday they had 3 players with a WRC+ &gt; 100 in their lineup), which are not even surprising to me. And that's even though a miracle happend and Judge and Stanton were healthy all the season. The rest of the lineup is just not good enough to win anything in the postseason. The Yankees had their 13 (?) games winning stretch, but outside of that they were to mediocre, so that there may be some Yankee fans questioning themselves how the Yankees could even make it to the WC game.

With that in mind I wasn't too surprised that we won (and especially how we did that) yesterday. Although their pitching was good this season (starting rotation was fine, bullpen was good), it was obvious that Cole had some struggles in the second half of the season. I am glad we pushed the right buttons offensively and added another big-time struggle to his list.

&amp;#x200B;

As we went with a slight advantage (in my opinion) in yesterday's game, we are obviously in the underdog role against the Rays. The Rays have been so strong for years and are such a well-managed organization. But even if we get swept, that is totally okay for me. This season went so much better than expected, that there is nothing to lose against the Rays.",2021-10-06,13:15,"[401361933, '401361933']"
"I'm tired of many writers crediting the Red Sox win based on the Yankees sucking. Which they did and do. But they sucked mostly because the Red Sox were good.

"After last season and the general shit surrounding sports due to COVID, I enjoyed watching a lot of this season.  It felt competitive and was actually fun to watch.  Beating the Yankees was icing on the cake, and it happened due to exceptional playing.  The Yankees blew it, but there were some amazing plays and pitching by the Red Sox.

I‚Äôm holding onto this high until tomorrow as I don‚Äôt expect them to beat the Rays but I‚Äôm still a proud Red Sox fan and get at least a few months to smugly tell my Yankee fan coworkers they can suck it.",2021-10-07,00:01,[]
