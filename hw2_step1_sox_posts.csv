A large part of the Yankee demise goes to Judge. He was MIA at the plate for 95% of this series. Then drops a routine fly in center that opened up the floodgates in the 6th. And he should‚Äôve laid himself out for that fly to center that wouldve ended the inning instead of letting it sail over his head.,2024-10-31,09:11

As a Mariners fan I'm happy for Papi and the Red Sox fan base. Edgar gets an award named after him and Ortiz gets to be a first round no doubt Hall of famer. You can debate the numbers all day and there is case to be made for both. But why have that debate today. As a Mariners fan we spent too many off seasons rooting for Edgar to get in for this not to be an exciting day for us too. The debate is over a DH can be a HOFer but now Papi has made the voters concede the fact that a DH can not only be a HOFer but a a first round HOFer. This idea that the DH isn't a real position is dead in the water especially with the eventuality of the DH in the NL. This is a good day for baseball. So thanks for the epic career Papi. Truly some of the best hitting and clutch ABs the game has ever seen.,2022-01-26,01:31
"Ortiz gets into the Hall simply by way of embodying an entire major American city and dispelling so much positivity and energy onto it‚Äôs people. One of the last big, bombastic, cartoon baseball personalities before the homogeneous turnover of the sport. 

You can‚Äôt understate clutch. You just can‚Äôt, Dan. It‚Äôs the most important stat there is. That‚Äôs the magic of this whole thing, and he was the most magical. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúsports‚Äù without melodramatic pay-off, and David Ortiz made that shit look like a cheesy movie more times than anybody.",2022-01-26,01:02

However, I respectfully refute that it's the greatest Boston moment. IMO, the Sox coming back from that 3-0 series Yankee lead and going on to sweep the Cards to win their first championship in 86 years, is still the greatest sports moment I've ever lived through. Call it nostalgia, call it a bit bias due to my love for the Sox being greater than the Patriots. But I still get goosebumps over them coming back on the Yankees and following through the rest of the way for that title. It's my most memorable &amp; beloved moment to see them hoist that trophy.

"Goodbye to the reason I fell in love with baseball. Damn, he made an Arab love baseball, I guess a father's influence is the strongest. Forever 34...",2016-10-10,22:00
"I didn't grow up a Red Sox fan. Baseball was never really watched in my household, and if anything my dad was a O's fan. 2003 brought me into the fold by bringing all of New England close to the brink and then getting crushed. But that excitement... I was hooked. 2004 and all its majesty was the first full season I paid attention to the Red Sox, and from that moment forward I've been a die-hard Sox fan. 

One man was the glue the held it all together, the single most clutch hitter I will likely ever see, a man who not only brought the Sox their first win in 86 years but was a (if not -the-) cog in bringing home two more, the man who even as far back as AOL Instant Messenger was my favorite player as immortalized by the original nickname PapiPedroManny. Big Papi. The Large Father. David Ortiz.

One day when I'm old and grey I will regale my Sox loving grandchildren with stories of how the legend truly doesn't capture the man. How there was simply something different in the air when he came up to bat with the game on the line. How I got to see Ortiz live. How I got see Papi hit a home run. How when it came down to it, Papi always somehow had the well the never ran out to go to when the team needed him most. 

And I won't be alone. David was every kid who grew up with the Red Sox in the past decade's favorite player. It was practically a requirement. The Red Sox will move on. Even now with this loss they're in one of the best positions in baseball moving forward over the next five years, and look to build on this success with more from the core next year. But it won't be the same. Everything is different now.

The use of the word 'era' is one of the most overused terms in sports. If a player has a couple good years somewhere than leaves, it's inevitably the end of that guys era. But here, now, it's more than apropos. The David Ortiz Era has ended. The Era of The Idiots has ended. The team that brought the Red Sox back to World Series glory is now all gone. My childhood baseball team, my first team... it's over. I know now, even at 23, that nothing as special as these past dozen years of the David Ortiz Era will ever come to pass. Not for me.

So as one tiny Sox fan in a sea of Red, thank you Mr. Ortiz. You were, everything boiled down, the reason I became the baseball fan I am today. And that is a gift I can never repay. ",2016-10-10,22:28

"Well, what else is there to say. Truly a shame that this team got swept. So much young talent and a helluva regular season. This team will be good for the next 4 or 5 years and probably make the playoffs those years with the core that we have in the lineup. 


End of an era. The last remnant of 2004 moves on. It's truly a feat in sports these days to see a big time athlete stick around for 13 years with one team and have the impact Ortiz has had on a team and a city. He picked us up in 2004 when the anxiety and ""here we go again"" hopelessness was at a fever pitch with the Yankees still riding the wave of the 90s success. Then 9 years later he picked up a city again exclaiming ""this is our fuckin city"" at a time when sports transcended real life tragedy. He didn't just change the expectations of a fan base, he changed the entire attitude of a region. Transformed the label of lovable losers into force to be reckoned with and perennial pennant threat. 


It's cliche to say things like ""a once in a generation athlete/player,"" but in Ortiz's case it could not be more appropriate. There will likely never be another curse or another 86 year period of toil. The team has been elevated. Guys want to play for the Boston fans now instead of holding disdain toward them like in the late 80s and early 90s. His demeanor and smile transferred to the city and fan base. It's something that is very rarely seen in modern sports where an athlete takes the time to devote himself to a city and region. I'm sure he'll have a role to play with the Red Sox in some form or another whether it be a bench coach or hitting coach in a few years, but for now, I can't help but shed a tear or two. No single player ever has and probably ever will make me feel as high as watching David Ortiz play baseball did.


His stats don't tell his story. In four years when he's eligible for the Hall, he'll be picked apart stat by stat and lazily compared to Edgar Martinez by talking heads who have probably never attended a game at Fenway to see the crowd react to Papi coming to the plate. Stats do not and cannot account for everything Ortiz did in 13 years in Boston. Stats don't exist for coming up to the plate in the late innings down by a run or two yet feeling like the game is still well in hand because Papi is on deck with a runner on. He had a better career in 13 years in Boston than most players have in 18 or 20 years.


While it's the end of an era in Boston, he leaves the team in good hands. It's important that we got a season of success with Mookie, Anthony, JBJ, and all the other young bucks to learn from one of the greatest. He'll never be forgotten, but damn, for the near future, that 3 spot will feel empty without the big guy coming up to the plate. Rest those aching feet Papi, you don't have to carry the city on your back anymore.",2016-10-10,22:46
"It doesn't matter if this gets lost in the thread, amongst all the other comments like this. All that matters is paying respect to the man who has done so much for us.

"I remember being in high school in the Dominican Republic for my senior year when the '04 October happened.

I don't know if you guys know this, but in the Dominican there were no Red Sox fans in the 90s. It was all Yankees, but Pedro and Papi changed that forever.

I remember that ALCS. I remember all the Yankee fans at school giving me shit all day after game 3. I remember the papers saying we were done.

I remember game 4, but most of all I remember game 5. God, I loved that headline. It said ""THE YANKEES' BIG FATHER"" in Spanish, and the photo of David rounding first after that game winning hit in the 14th inning. It was awesome after hearing Pedro call the Yankees his daddy, and all the bullshit that came of that, have David be called the Yankees' daddy all by himself. 

I remember '07. It cemented the idea that the curse was really over. That '04 wasn't a fluke. That we could win championships for real, and often.

Then there's 2013. Man, what can I say about that? The island literally stopped to watch Big Papi fucking crush that postseason. Nobody missed 1 second of 1 game.

I recall watching that ALCS grand slam at my father's house. Bases loaded... ""what if he hits a homer now? Could you imagine? That'd be crazy."" And BOOM! TIE GAME!

I remember running into him at the gym every off season. The man worked out every day like he had some baseball to play in December. We were doing bench press right next to each other once, and he said hi to me like we'd been friends for years ""Que lo que mi hermano?"", smiled and hugged me. If you wanna call him a celebrity, he's the nicest one on the planet, by far.

I ran into him on the elevator once before that, and I asked him why he worked out so hard in December, and he said it's the only way to stay in shape for March. ""Old guys don't have the luxury of vacations"" 

I hope I run into him again when I'm down there for Christmas. Part of me finds solace in the fact that I'll get to see him from time to time, but I'm mostly sad that we won't be seeing him walk up to the plate and put on that beautiful show.

We'll miss you, big man. Thanks for the memories. We'll cherish them forever.

You are the Red Sox's savior. You were the reason we ended the 86 year drought. You were the reason we became a premier team in this league and one of the biggest parts of 3 championship teams.

"David Ortiz changed my life and I'll always carry him with me. I grew up as an American expat in New Delhi,  India and clung fiercely to baseball and the few Nickelodeon VHS tapes my parents brought over. For a while, baseball and pop culture were really the only ties to my American identity beyond my parents. Outside of occasional games on summer road trips through the US, I didn't have the chance to watch or truly follow a Major League Baseball team until ESPN Star Sports started airing NESN and YES games at 530 in the morning. For a kid, the Idiots were a fun, easy choice over the stoic Yankees. The 2003 postseason broke my heart, but cemented my status as a Red Sox fan for life. After FINALLY making it to my first Red Sox game in 2007, I knew I was home. Papi and Manny each homered. The air was so thick with excitement and energy, you knew the ball was bound to hang up in the zone. 

Thanks to Large Father, I applied only to schools in  Boston, was lucky enough to live across the Pike on Newbury Street so I could wake up to Fenway every morning and felt like I had been a Bostonian all my life, soaking in the game day buzz from my porch. I even went to more than 50 games during the Bobby Valentine train wreck just to watch Papi react to every little change in the game. 

Thanks to Papi, I picked a great University that helped my startup grow semi pro and youth baseball in India. Seeing what baseball did for him keeps me going every day. His energy and joy for baseball has been in my bones since I used to get up for games every morning, too thrilled to be sleepy. There's talent in India. There's unbridled love for baseball in players here. I know that if Papi could have gone from a kid who just wanted to have fun to Boston's favorite son, so could so many of the wonderful Indian kids I see take the field every day. 

I cried like a baby in front of my players watching Marco come in for Ortiz during our morning practice yesterday. When I looked up, however, I couldn't help but smile. I saw more than 30 Indian teens, some gutted at the red sox loss, some in my face gloating that we won't have the AL's best offense anymore, and others still  talking about the Nats chances and how they think the hot stove season will play out. If it weren't for David Ortiz, I may have never held onto that passion for baseball and we may have never started our pipe dream baseball league here. No matter whether we develop India's first major leagues or simply maintain a fun youth league, I feel so moved that a single player with a booming voice, wide smile and deadly bat could change so many lives 8000 miles from Fenway. 

I love you David. Thank you for everything you've done and will continue to do to keep the love and joy in baseball.",2016-10-12,07:21

I'd go into detention the next day and my teachers and I would talk about how incredible he was. Keep in mind he's always terrorized my tigers, to me he's the most clutch player in any sport.

"He is my favorite athlete of all time. I will always be glad that I got to watch him play for so long. I first got into baseball, and the Sox, during the 2001 season, when I was 9. Those early 2000s teams were the foundation of my appreciation for this sport, and my memories of those early days with Ortiz and Manny crushing everything are still strong. 2004 is and always will be my most cherished sports memory, and Papi is always the first person who comes to mind. It would have been enough if that was all he ever did, but it wasn't. My favorite thing about this season was watching the *fear* opposing pitchers had on the mound when he was at the plate. No one ever wanted to pitch to him, at age 40. 

I am not so much upset that the Sox lost as I am that Papi lost. This team is great and only going to get better in the years to come. There will be plenty of chances for them to win another title. They'll just be doing it without my favorite player.",2016-10-10,22:04

"In 2002 I was given a hat with a letter B on it.  I was a Mets fan at the time but I was also 9 and decided that this hat would be my newest favorite team.  I started watching the Red Sox, and there were two players that stood out to me, Manny and Papi.  Growing up in NC I had no real connection to Boston or the Red Sox, except through David Ortiz.  The man played with so much poise, power, and respect.  I've followed through the ups and downs since then and have been blessed to see 3 championships, and witness one game (in ATL) that Papi hit a home run in, a few sections away from me.  I was ecstatic that I witnessed my favorite player hit a homer in in person.  Over the years, Papi has given me a reason to watch, gave me an emotional connection to a team I just happened to choose to like based on a hat, and damn have I loved the last 14 years as a Red Sox fan, especially when the Bullpen Cop homer happened and you helped the city be #BostonStrong.  Thanks for the memories Papi, you have made me one proud Red Sox fan.",2016-10-10,22:16
"A baseball era is ending. Guys I grew up watching, loving, hating, are gone from the game. Wish it could have ended better for the large father, but I'm excited to tell my children and grandchildren about David Ortiz and what he meant to Red Sox fans everywhere. ",2016-10-10,22:16
Got to see him at Fenway on my birthday in May. I'll miss you papi. ,2016-10-10,22:16
"Every single time he got up to that fucking plate of his career it was like the whole stadium was ready for him to hit a homerun, that's how clutch he was as a hitter. Not just that but he was so  funny, he didn't give a fuck what anyone thought, he smashed a fucking telephone at another teams ballpark, he said fuck on  television, and at every opportunity he was the leader and even tonight he got his team going. I'm gonna cry a lot tonight and it's because I'm gonna miss the fuck out him.",2016-10-10,22:16
"So fun to watch him. He played a big part in the 2013 series, a series that Boston needed.

I'll miss you, large father. ",2016-10-10,22:17
"He made believe miracles were possible. 2004 wouldn't have happened without him. Thank you, Large Father, we'll love you forever.",2016-10-10,22:17
I'm a 27 year old man and I'm crying.  I feel so fucking old.  My childhood feels gone.,2016-10-10,22:19
"I'm really, really going to miss him. He could have retired the second after he beat the snot out of those prissy bitches from New York in 2004 and he would still be my favorite ball player ever. But he gave us two more series and a thousand other moments that I'll remember for the rest of my life. Thank you, Papi, for everything. 

Man, this really hurts, doesn't it? ",2016-10-10,22:19
"When I was around ten, my dad got tickets for the Red Sox when they came to Anaheim. We got there right when the gates opened, and I immediately ran down to the Red Sox dugout. For whatever reason, Papi was in the stands right in the first row. Being a little kid, I shoved my way into the front of the circle that formed around him as he talked with fans. Did I ever say a word to him? Of course not I was too scared. But I still remember just being in his presence, just knowing I was there by him. I was a little kid then, and now I've felt like I've grown up. ",2016-10-10,22:20
"Hearing everyone in Fenway chant ""Thank you Papi"" after the game was over was really nice. Even though it was over, the fans still gave the man the respect he deserved.

Thank you, Papi. ",2016-10-10,22:21
HIS FLAIR SHALL NEVER FADE,2016-10-10,22:23
"I was 11 years old when the Red Sox signed David Ortiz. That year, I remember advocating that Jeremy Giambi should be the DH after a decent spring training. 13 years, three World Series wins, and countless memories later, it's time to say goodbye.

I write little elegies for retired sports folk a few times a year, but this one is the hardest yet. Without Big Papi, probably my greatest memory in life wouldn't exist. David Ortiz wasn't just an athlete. His words lifted me up when I could barely conceive happiness - (""This is our fucking city""). His smile, belief, and passion made every summer just a bit better. His story made me think that I could achieve anything if I worked hard enough. His dedication to not just the game, but to the community was enough to save lives.
It's stupid to feel so sad that you can't watch a millionaire play a relatively meaningless sport ever again, I get it. But to me, Big Papi feels like a friend. He feels like that guy that was there for you when you needed it the most, and without him, baseball can never be the same to me.

Thank you, Papi. In my most honest and sincere belief, thank you for everything. I don't think you could ever understand how much you'll be missed. Like I asked my relatives for stories about seeing Ted Williams play, I know I'll be telling stories of seeing you play for the rest of my life. You are truly one of the greats.

See you all next Spring. Go Sox.",2016-10-10,22:26
"Pathetic. David Ortiz deserved better, his team failed him. Such a bittersweet ending. ",2016-10-10,22:27
"Thank you for making the last decade of my grandpas life the best years Red Sox-wise he could've asked for (he passed this June, buried with his Red Sox hat)",2016-10-10,22:27
"Throughout the decade I've followed baseball, he's one of the players I've known since the start, and is who I think will always be one of the best to ever play the game, especially in my time. Always liked him, he seemed like a great guy, a class act, and had the stats to back it up. I'll miss him being in the league. Glad he could at least end his career at Fenway. Thank you, Big Papi.",2016-10-10,22:43

"Alright I did some quick math on baseball-reference. I tallied the career bWAR to date of every player taken in rounds 2-5 in the 2011 draft except for Mookie Betts.

That's 52 Major League players, 48 of whom were drafted before Mookie. The combined career WAR of these 52 players as of right now is **32.2.**

Mookie Betts has amassed **35.2** career WAR. Per my calculations, **35.2** &gt; **32.2**. Mookie Betts is worth more than two full teams-worth of Major League Baseball players, don't look into that, it's verifiable and I have the numbers to prove it so let's just move on.

It's even better when we restrict it to just the 5th round: compared to Mookie's 35.2, the rest of that 5th round draft class has produced 3.1 career war. Combined. Mookie's accumulated more than 10x as much WAR as every other player taken in that round put together.

And, for what it's worth, the most valuable player taken in the 1st round by WAR that year is currently Francisco Lindor at 23.9. He's a fantastic baseball player too.",2018-11-16,00:54

"Excuse the throwaway (for anonymity), but I promise you what I'm about to say is a true first-hand account of my experience with Jack. I grew up playing against him, and then played with him in college. I've been extremely proud of what he's accomplished in his career, but I can't say I'm surprised.

Personal anecdote first, I grew up playing baseball year round, and managed to find myself on a damn good travel ball team between 13 and 15 years old. This isn't to brag, or anything, just to give you an idea that we didn't mess around, played some good ball, and weren't too easy to impress. We won a lot of tournaments. We had a lot of good players. 5 of us went on to play D-1 college ball. We had a great rivalry with a team named the Tidewater Drillers, out of Virginia, and got the better of them more than they got us. The Tidewater Drillers ""alumni"" includes Mark Reynolds, Chris Taylor, David Winfree, and Ryan Zimmerman. I played against Taylor, but I don't remember him the way I remember Jackie.

In my 2-3 years on this team, we didn't get beat often, however, we were run-ruled just one time, by the Richmond Braves. This team was a bunch of donkeys. Obviously, in teenage years, some kids grow faster than others, and in sports, that advantage can be huge. We had four or five of those. The Braves had 12. Except for one small black kid they put in centerfield. We figured he must be pretty good to be on this team, but he looked tiny next to his teammates. He's hitting lead off, and starts the game off by smacking a line-drive double to the warning track. This went on the entire game, and yes, we did get to see his arm from center. We got their big sticks out a few times, and handled the lineup pretty well. Except this CFer. He went 5-5 against us, with 3 or 4 doubles, and was hitting piss missiles every time. But this is what impressed me the most. This kid's running around the bases damn near every inning, he's chasing balls all over the outfield, and any time he wasn't doing that, he was outside the dugout, taking swings off a tee into a net. The entire game. Different drills. Different swings. Hitting to all fields. He was perfecting his craft in the middle of a game, at 14 years old. To this day, he's the only person I've seen do that. We ended up losing that game 10-0, which had never happened to us, and we couldn't even be mad about it. They all whooped our ass, but we were just amazed by that little CFer, more than anything else.

Fast forward a few years, and I was a walk-on at the University of South Carolina. I meet Jackie, and we get to talking. I knew he was from around my area, so I started asking him where he played, and came to realize, he was that CFer from all those years ago. And he hadn't changed. In that locker room, there were walk-ons like me that knew this was the last stop before beer league. There were guys with god-given ability that wasted it. There were guys you'd watch and think they've got a chance to make it to the show (Whit Merrifield, for one). And then there was JBJ. It was transcendent with him. He was going to make it to the Bigs. You could just tell by the way he played. The way he worked. The way he spoke. He was humble, hard-working, and quiet. Yet he still had this major league vibe about him, and you could feel that this just going to be a chapter to a very long career. He's a class act and a great personality, with great parents who came to every single weekend series. Off the field, he'd occasionally DD friends, but I don't think I ever saw him take a sip of alcohol. That had to have been hard to do with that team, in particular, and an SEC environment. He was a true professional from the very beginning.

On top of his approach to the game, his two national titles, CWS MOP, and his hitting, he has a fucking Howitzer attached to his torso, and he is far and away the best defensive centerfielder I've ever seen. He was going to the Show on his defense alone. He could hit .150 and he'd still be a tremendous late game replacement. I got to see it every day. I played a bit of corner outfield, but center is tough. Jackie knows where the ball is going to be as soon as it hits the bat. I've watched him do it thousands of times, and I can count on one hand how many times I've seen him misjudge a ball. I still don't know how he does it with that straight-on angle. His instincts are supernatural.

Anyways, to wrap this up, I've been so proud of him over the years, but this series was something else. From what I've seen out of Boston fans, you guys accept his hitting for what it is because of how damn good he is out there in the toughest outfield in baseball. I appreciate the love y'all have for him, and just wanted to share my personal experience as an insight to who Jackie is, and that he deserves to be ballin. He's always been a big-stage player, and I've been jumping out of my seat watching him this week. I'm rooting for y'all to win this shit. Go Sox!

This is such an awesome story. I have always loved JBJ. There is just something about him that makes it impossible to dislike him. He plays the game the way its supposed to be played. I hope he gets to stay in Boston for a long time. ,2018-10-19,08:42

"His slumps are hard to take, for sure. But if you look at the advanced stats, you see that he's been pretty damn unlucky at the plate this year, and obviously kills it in the field. He's a great teammate, works hard, and is a damn golden boy when he's interviewed. 

All those intangibles, mighty fine defense, and the occasional streak of a power bat... I think he's earned his $6M salary. Let's hope he can carry his success in this series to the biggest stage there is.

Thanks for your story!",2018-10-19,10:04

"I have friends who grew up playing ball with Jackie. I have friends who graduated with Jackie and know his wife very well. Guy is an all around class act. One of the better parts about your story is the part about his professionalism at a young age. Another local kid was drafted by the Red Sox organization and never could pan out. It was partially skill but constantly being held down because of drug use. And in an area where Jackie is from drugs have become rampant. It‚Äôs great to see the success of Jackie.

I'm pretty sure most of their roster went D1 and I know a couple who got drafted from their team (Devon Fisher who is in the sox system now). I think they were on the team when JBJ was at South Carolina and killing it in the CWS and they all had nothing but great things to say about him.,2018-10-19,13:38

"I‚Äôm going to assume you played with the canes (before they were the evoshield canes)? I played with the braves, though a few years after. That Braves team JBJ was on was absurd though. A cousin of mine played 3B for them and was 1 of 2 kids on a 20 kid roster to go d3 (the rest either d1 or JUCO). The other to make a big name for himself on that braces team was Danny Hultzen. They won the perfect game tournament down in Georgia with near ease due to how stacked they were. I love seeing JBJ perform like this.

"I don't doubt compared to talent in a youth league a guy like JBJ seems transcendent. At the MLB level, he isn't an elite hitter but every MLB player was no doubt dominant at lower levels.

I don't say that to criticize JBJ. He is a defensive player first. And he may be the best defensive Center Fielder in the entire world. So he has nothing to be ashamed of when he is streaky and can't hit for a while.

But I absolutely believe his anecdote about him being humble even back then. JBJ has always come across as a very even-keel guy who doesn't get emotional when he is struggling or succeeding. He just always puts his head down and gets to work, no matter the situation.

JBJ hit .400 in this series if I recall. No one should expect to see JBJ hit .400 next year. I doubt he'll hit .300 next year. But I'm really glad he got his moment in the sun.",2018-10-19,13:10

"HOUSTON (AP) -- Researchers in Houston today announced a shocking discovery that has upended the scientific world. They say they have collected conclusive evidence that 13-year old Rafael Devers is the biological father of 36-year old Justin Verlander.

""This discovery upends everything we know about not only human biology but also the linear nature of time,"" said Solo Johnson, one of the researchers on the team that announced the discovery. ""But the data we have collected allows for no other conclusion.""

Researchers say they first became suspicious of Verlander's true paternity in October 2018 when Devers ""totally dad dicked"" Verlander in the ALCS. But their sample size at the time was too small to pass scientific muster.

Now they report further testing has confirmed their prior findings.

""After observing the young third baseman again assert his fatherly dominance at Verlander's own park, we can now say with 100 percent scientific certainty that Rafael Devers is Justin Verlander's biological father.""

Although earlier findings drew skeptics from across the scientific community, the researchers' latest findings have produced wide-spread consensus.

""At first I said, 'Are you kidding me?'"" recounted Stat Masterson, chair of the Bridgepiece Studies Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""But now it's a beautiful thing. I'm telling ya.""

Scientists from around the world report that they expect another opportunity to observe the unusual father-son duo in their natural habitat this fall.",2019-05-26,18:36

"I know there are gonna be a ton of people calling for Cora's head and I know that series sucked. To go up like that and then squander a 2-1 lead really sucks. I just want to highlight the amazing things that happened this year for the Red Sox:

* We found Kyle from Waltham.
* We came back down 4 against the Yankees when we were getting no hit.
* We eliminated the Yankees.
* We eliminated the Rays.
* We won 92 games in a division where 4 teams won 90 games or more.
* We saved our farm system instead of mortgaging it for one season like in 2018.
* We have Marcelo Maier.
* Garrett Whitlock and Tanner Houck will be in the rotation next year.
* Nate Eovaldi became an ace.
* We set records for Grand Slams in the playoffs.
* We had the most comeback wins in the league.
* We got through the last 2 months without a closer.
* The crowds at Fenway this year, especially in the playoffs, were absolutely insane.

Then they beat the Rays to become a ALCS contender.

Then they hit three grand slams in the ALCS.

Do I feel good about this team and it's prospects for the 2022 season? Damn right I do.

The only free agents that concern me are Eduardo Rodriguez, Adam Ottavino and Jose Iglesias (Yes, I would like to see Iglesias remain with the Red Sox).

"‚ÄúDoes anyone else feel like the Red Sox were given way too much clout in pre-season projections, or is it only me?

No, I'm not surprised by an 0-3 start, but hear me out...

In a lot of pre-season projections, the Red Sox were consistently projected to reach 80-83 wins. USA Today pegged them at 80-82, CBS Sports had them at 79.5 (round to 80 for the sake of argument), and PECOTA estimated 79.8 (again, round to 80) wins.

I just don't see our hated rivals hovering around .500 at all this season. Verdugo, Martinez, Bogaerts and Devers do create a formidable heart of the order, but who else in their lineup can hit? Kike Hernandez is the only other notable name in their lineup, and he has a career .735 OPS.

I don't need to go into detail about the rotation, especially since Sale could be out until any point between May and August. Eduardo Rodriguez is a slightly above average pitcher when healthy, but that's about it.

The bullpen? Matt Barnes isn't that good, and Ottaviano cannot flourish in high-leverage situations or tight games. The rest of their bullpen is makeshift.

Maybe I'll end up being wrong, but I fail to see how the Red Sox will be anywhere near .500 this season.‚Äù

And we got Iglesias back and he repaid the favor.  That was a highlight this year.

And we did it with class -- example: Cora yelling at E-Rod when he mocked Correia on his way off the field with the looking at his watch schtick.  He praised his performance (which deserved it), but clearly told him ""we don't do that kind of crap here!""  That's why we continue to love Cora and why we loved this team.",2021-10-23,14:27

"Losing is always shit and people can be justifiably pissed at some of the short comings and mistakes, but it was a hell of a year.",2021-10-23,16:14
"One thing I'd argue is that Whitlock should continue his role as a multi-inning relief weapon. I think we're one great starter away from having a solid playoff rotation. If you can stick someone near the top with Sale and Eovaldi and have Houck and Pivetta as a 4 and 5 with exciting potential, that is a playoff rotation. But our bullpen is what proved to be the thinnest when it really mattered. Figure out Barnes, have Whitlock as your stopper in the bullpen, and find 3 top of the line bullpen arms to supplement them, that is a scary pitching staff. Maybe even stretch Whitlock out as the season progresses.",2021-10-23,16:22
"Dombrowski got so much flak for Nate's extension, I probably added some in there myself. But holy shit did it pan out. A reliable workhorse at the top of the rotation when our ace went down for the better part of 2 seasons was an absolute lifesaver. Without Nate in the rotation, we don't make the playoffs.",2021-10-23,16:35
I hope nobody's calling for Cora's head... he's a big part of us getting as far as we did. I'm proud as hell and excited for the future. Fuck the Yankees.,2021-10-23,22:57
"I found my way back to this team this year. I grew up a Sox fan in the late 90s. I moved to Ohio about ten years ago and couldn‚Äôt afford the MLB package and eventually lost contact with the team I loved. I went to Indians and Reds games. I went to minor league games. They were fun, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but they weren‚Äôt my first love. 
This year I went back to college in my late 30s and decided to take a chance on the student discount for MLB.tv. I watched about 75% of the Sox games this year and remembered why I love this game. 
They didn‚Äôt win the pennant this year, but they‚Äôve got me back for the long haul. 
Love you, Red Sox.",2021-10-23,22:57
"Eovaldi üôå good stuff!  Ps I‚Äôm kind of over Sales...   also 100% agreed we NEED a closer. 

I want to add. I think Tommy Goodwin (base running and outfield defense) being gone is a good move. Lets see if that improves our game?    Think Fenster will be called up, or leave him developing young players...?    Either way. Sayonara, Tommy.",2021-10-26,01:41
"Does anyone else feel like the Red Sox were given way too much clout in pre-season projections, or is it only me?

No, I'm not surprised by an 0-3 start, but hear me out...

In a lot of pre-season projections, the Red Sox were consistently projected to reach 80-83 wins. USA Today pegged them at 80-82, CBS Sports had them at 79.5 (round to 80 for the sake of argument), and PECOTA estimated 79.8 (again, round to 80) wins. 

I just don't see our hated rivals hovering around .500 at all this season. Verdugo, Martinez, Bogaerts and Devers do create a formidable heart of the order, but who else in their lineup can hit? Kike Hernandez is the only other notable name in their lineup, and he has a career .735 OPS. 

I don't need to go into detail about the rotation, especially since Sale could be out until any point between May and August. Eduardo Rodriguez is a slightly above average pitcher when healthy, but that's about it. 

The bullpen? Matt Barnes isn't that good, and Ottaviano cannot flourish in high-leverage situations or tight games. The rest of their bullpen is makeshift.

Maybe I'll end up being wrong, but I fail to see how the Red Sox will be anywhere near .500 this season.",2021-10-03,18:53
"I feel like the Sox strongly outperformed my expectations this regular season. After last year's 24-36 (.400 win %) fiasco, I hoped they could rebound to be a 500 ball club. Best case scenario, I saw 85 wins, which would have been a 20 win improvement if you project 2020 to a full 162 game season. 20 win improvements are super rare.

This year's team found ways to win a lot of games that appeared lost in the late innings. Of course the bullpen or lack of clutch hitting or bonehead base running led to a few late losses, but over 162 games all teams are going to deal with some of that.

Offensively, I had more hope than the OP. I felt Martinez was going to have a solid bounce back year. Without that, 500 ball isn't going to happen. Devers/Bogaerts, given where they are in their careers I think you can expect something in the very good to excellent range offensively under pretty much any scenario you can draw up. I've liked Verdugo since day 1 with the club. I think he's just developing into the kind of player he can be. 2020 was really his first year as an everyday player. That's the kind of player who can go either way - improve into a core part of the lineup or regress as the league figures out how to beat him. Solid progress.

Coming into the season I would have rated Renfroe higher than the OP seems to. He'd really only had 1 very good season in his career so far, 2018, but stepped up big time in an everyday role. I thought he'd be more of a platoon player. Had no idea how good he can be in RF.

Kike Hernandez and Christian Arroyo, I'd say both exceeded my expectations. They both came in as solid major leaguers. But so did Marwin Golzalez and Franchy Cordero (more limited sample size there). Win some, lost some...

Vazquez, I expected a better season offensively. 2019 and 2020 were solid. 23 HRs in 2019, 7 in essentially 1/3 of a full season last year. he ended up with an OB% that was pretty much a career low, and a Slugging % down over 100 points compared to the last 2 years. Sadly, he's kind of the JB Jr spot in the lineup now, albeit with a a little better OB% and worse power numbers. I'd have liked to have see Plawecki in more often.

Dalbec, didn't expect much out of him one way or the other, too raw a player to have a feel for what you can expect going into this season. Overall I think the Sox got solid production out of him.

Going into the season, based on what I wrote above, I felt they had made some potentially good offensive upgrades from the 2020 team, but they needed some bounces to go their way.",2021-10-04,15:18
We in this boys!,2021-10-04,14:54

"Wether it's war, expected wins, run differential, I still can't believe my Jays didn't make it.  I feel we deserved a better fait, but we're out.

"Go Sox!!!!  Loved the excitement and tension of the game, hated enduring Will Flemming's play by play of it!

"I‚Äôm really sick of people on this subreddit being endlessly negative about the Red Sox. Like why even come here if you‚Äôre not going to root for your team?

It makes us look bad.  Focus on the positives, be happy we‚Äôre not the Orioles.

Obviously the team isn‚Äôt perfect but who is?  Y‚Äôall decided a month ago that we weren‚Äôt going to make the playoffs and we still did despite your endless whining so who‚Äôs to say we won‚Äôt win again?

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Freeman. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin.

"Besides the cleating it was a late slide right at his back leg.
Top 5 Red Sox pitchers you would expect to throw at someone in retaliation:
5. Heath Hembree - Would be higher if he still looked like kenny powers
4. Erod - Threw at Machado, little more tame than throwing at his head
3. Chris Sale - Those jerseys didn't cut themselves, he dgaf if he's the best player
2. Matt Barnes - Threw at Machado's head, bit of over kill
1. Joe F'in Kelly - You can't great about him coming into a tie game, but you know he's gonna throw at someone if he has to

I don‚Äôt care that we scored 14 runs, if he gives up another 3-4 and struggles through a few innings the whole dynamic of the game is different. We literally had Matt Barnes warming up in the 1st inning to relieve Sale if he couldn‚Äôt get 3 outs.

"A lot of Sox fans are really soft now. Maybe it‚Äôs just Reddit? Honestly. 

I mean I think this is probably going to get me flak based on that other thread but I also do not understand the viciousness about some of them not being vaccinated. I‚Äôm a vaccinated person and I find the outrage pretty comical honestly. If them being a cross section of our country (I mean seriously it‚Äôs not just that unvaccinated people are selfish or dumb or whatever name you wanna call them this country has a lot of issues and frankly if you look at it objectively it makes sense some are paranoid and skeptical especially in certain communities like black communities, Latin communities, and poor people) is such an issue idk how these people watch games and root for these guys at all. Pro athletes have long had really bad, at times harmful opinions about things. 

If that‚Äôs going to stop you from rooting for your favorite baseball or have you say you hate JD Martinez idk. It seems wack. And to me it‚Äôs a similar phenomenon to the revisionist history about Machado. I‚Äôm pretty used to my favorite ballplayers not sharing my politics.

May their pinstripes turn into actual pins! May their slides always end short of the bag, and the plate! May their mitts be full of marshmallows!

In this past month, I've noticed that whenever I check their score and find them in a losing position, they always manage to rally and win the game! This happened multiple times with the Mets, Nationals, etc., but the final straw was the 5-0 lead Seattle blew last week.

I promised myself that I wouldn't check the score of their game even one single time, and the result is there for all of you to see! SWEEP!!! Needless to say, I won't be checking another Yankee score for the rest of the season.

"Fuck the Yankees.

We had such a weird season against them this year. We started off sweeping them at the start. I thought that was the trend of the year. Then that mid season fiasco happened, with all the bad calls and the fan throwing the ball at Verdugo.

Then I thought we could bounce back. But they kicked our asses late in the season. So I was really worried when I found out we needed to play a single game wild card against them. Winner take all.

Well guess what. Fuck them. WE WON. FUCK THE YANKEES!",2021-10-06,07:50

But you wildly exceeded expectations just by getting into the playoffs. All I needed to see was that they weren‚Äôt content with just being there. Last night, every player treated the whole game like it was game 7 of the world series. They looked crisp and sharp. We saw stellar pitching, stellar fielding, and great at bats. This team was hungry for a victory. 

We still got some pieces to address, but the future looks bright for the Sox.",2021-10-06,10:30

"I didn't understand and I still do not understand why the Yankees were ranked so high before the season in all that predictions. I mean, look at their offensive numbers this season (yesterday they had 3 players with a WRC+ &gt; 100 in their lineup), which are not even surprising to me. And that's even though a miracle happend and Judge and Stanton were healthy all the season. The rest of the lineup is just not good enough to win anything in the postseason. The Yankees had their 13 (?) games winning stretch, but outside of that they were to mediocre, so that there may be some Yankee fans questioning themselves how the Yankees could even make it to the WC game.

With that in mind I wasn't too surprised that we won (and especially how we did that) yesterday. Although their pitching was good this season (starting rotation was fine, bullpen was good), it was obvious that Cole had some struggles in the second half of the season. I am glad we pushed the right buttons offensively and added another big-time struggle to his list.

&amp;#x200B;

As we went with a slight advantage (in my opinion) in yesterday's game, we are obviously in the underdog role against the Rays. The Rays have been so strong for years and are such a well-managed organization. But even if we get swept, that is totally okay for me. This season went so much better than expected, that there is nothing to lose against the Rays.",2021-10-06,13:15

It was weaker 1991-1993.,2023-05-07,19:15
Wow.,2023-05-07,20:02
That dude was such a moron in the Yanks sub. Acting all high and mighty when the Yanks haven‚Äôt won shit in 14 years. Also thought we traded Devers,2023-05-07,21:06

"We play 18 more games against teams with a connection to the ocean (the Rays, Mariners, Marlins, and Pirates), and 130 games against everyone else.  Assuming we lose all 18 games against the ocean teams, and maintain our current winning percentage of .857 against the land-based teams, we should go 111-37 in the remainer of the season.  

On a more somber note, postseason success will obviously depend on us not meeting the Rays or Mariners in the playoffs.",2023-04-15,04:33

"Orioles and Angels are sky-based. The only land-based team we've faced is the Tigers.
