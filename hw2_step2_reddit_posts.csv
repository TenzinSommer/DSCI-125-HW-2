Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, but we‚Äôd like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we‚Äôll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you‚Äôd like while you‚Äôre in town.‚Äù My sister and cousin were both like ‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs cool.‚Äù and I kind of played the asshole a bit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just don‚Äôt understand. We‚Äôve been here for 15 minutes - we‚Äôve just ordered. Can‚Äôt we finish our meal here?‚Äù Then out of nowhere Aaron Judge shows up next to the manager and says ‚ÄúPaul, these guys can finish. We‚Äôll be at the bar. I got some time.‚Äù And I (being a big fan of massive dongers) said ‚ÄúOh wow, uh‚Ä¶ I had no idea.

I get that the inner circle who apparently have a TON of time to spend on here thinks it's funny, but a lot of us came over from r/yankees because that sub became such a joke, and we wanted something more substantive and active. This was a better alternative, but I'm not so sure that's the case now because this high school style clique has formed and all they do is spew nothing but inside jokes that few people even understand.
  
Do we have to start a new Yankees sub that's not childish as fuck or completely inactive? Or will the mods start doing their job and make this a community for all 7k+ members and not just one for the handful of idiots that think this is their high school lunch table?
  
Sad to see that lesser teams' subs (r/Reds) are getting actual players to do AMAs, and this sub is filled with a bunch of people who, over a full 24 hour span, think it's hilarious that someone accidentally posted a news article more than once, so they respond by posting the same fucking thing over and over in every language possible. It's not funny, it's just annoying.
  
I'm sure the regulars guilty of what I'm talking about will shit on this post (I can't wait for every comment to be the immature but wholly predictable ""So what happened with Jacob Lindgren har har""), but lurkers and lesser involved members: Do I have a point here?

2714,"Well, what else is there to say. Truly a shame that this team got swept. So much young talent and a helluva regular season. This team will be good for the next 4 or 5 years and probably make the playoffs those years with the core that we have in the lineup. 


End of an era. The last remnant of 2004 moves on. It's truly a feat in sports these days to see a big time athlete stick around for 13 years with one team and have the impact Ortiz has had on a team and a city. He picked us up in 2004 when the anxiety and ""here we go again"" hopelessness was at a fever pitch with the Yankees still riding the wave of the 90s success. Then 9 years later he picked up a city again exclaiming ""this is our fuckin city"" at a time when sports transcended real life tragedy. He didn't just change the expectations of a fan base, he changed the entire attitude of a region. Transformed the label of lovable losers into force to be reckoned with and perennial pennant threat. 


It's cliche to say things like ""a once in a generation athlete/player,"" but in Ortiz's case it could not be more appropriate. There will likely never be another curse or another 86 year period of toil. The team has been elevated. Guys want to play for the Boston fans now instead of holding disdain toward them like in the late 80s and early 90s. His demeanor and smile transferred to the city and fan base. It's something that is very rarely seen in modern sports where an athlete takes the time to devote himself to a city and region. I'm sure he'll have a role to play with the Red Sox in some form or another whether it be a bench coach or hitting coach in a few years, but for now, I can't help but shed a tear or two. No single player ever has and probably ever will make me feel as high as watching David Ortiz play baseball did.


His stats don't tell his story. In four years when he's eligible for the Hall, he'll be picked apart stat by stat and lazily compared to Edgar Martinez by talking heads who have probably never attended a game at Fenway to see the crowd react to Papi coming to the plate. Stats do not and cannot account for everything Ortiz did in 13 years in Boston. Stats don't exist for coming up to the plate in the late innings down by a run or two yet feeling like the game is still well in hand because Papi is on deck with a runner on. He had a better career in 13 years in Boston than most players have in 18 or 20 years.


While it's the end of an era in Boston, he leaves the team in good hands. It's important that we got a season of success with Mookie, Anthony, JBJ, and all the other young bucks to learn from one of the greatest. He'll never be forgotten, but damn, for the near future, that 3 spot will feel empty without the big guy coming up to the plate.

3811,"Does anyone else feel like the Red Sox were given way too much clout in pre-season projections, or is it only me?

No, I'm not surprised by an 0-3 start, but hear me out...

In a lot of pre-season projections, the Red Sox were consistently projected to reach 80-83 wins. USA Today pegged them at 80-82, CBS Sports had them at 79.5 (round to 80 for the sake of argument), and PECOTA estimated 79.8 (again, round to 80) wins. 

I just don't see our hated rivals hovering around .500 at all this season. Verdugo, Martinez, Bogaerts and Devers do create a formidable heart of the order, but who else in their lineup can hit? Kike Hernandez is the only other notable name in their lineup, and he has a career .735 OPS. 

I don't need to go into detail about the rotation, especially since Sale could be out until any point between May and August. Eduardo Rodriguez is a slightly above average pitcher when healthy, but that's about it. 

The bullpen? Matt Barnes isn't that good, and Ottaviano cannot flourish in high-leverage situations or tight games. The rest of their bullpen is makeshift.

Maybe I'll end up being wrong, but I fail to see how the Red Sox will be anywhere near .500 this season.",2021-10-03,['401229469'],BOS,"['anyon', 'els', 'feel', 'like', 'red', 'sox', 'given', 'way', 'much', 'clout', 'pre-season', 'project', 'surpris', '0-3', 'start', 'hear', '...', 'lot', 'pre-season', 'project', 'red', 'sox', 'consist', 'project', 'reach', '80-83', 'win', 'usa', 'today', 'peg', '80-82', 'cb', 'sport', '79.5', 'round', 'sake', 'argument', 'pecota', 'estim', '79.8', 'round', 'win', ""n't"", 'see', 'hate', 'rival', 'hover', 'around', '.500', 'season', 'verdugo', 'martinez', 'bogaert', 'dever', 'creat', 'formid', 'heart', 'order', 'els', 'lineup', 'hit', 'kike', 'hernandez', 'notabl', 'name', 'lineup', 'career', '.735', 'op', ""n't"", 'need', 'detail', 'rotat', 'especi', 'sinc', 'sale', 'could', 'point', 'may', 'august', 'eduardo', 'rodriguez', 'slightli', 'averag', 'pitcher', 'healthi', 'bullpen', 'matt', 'barn', ""n't"", 'good', 'ottaviano', 'flourish', 'high-leverag', 'situat', 'tight', 'game', 'rest', 'bullpen', 'makeshift', 'mayb', ""'ll"", 'end', 'wrong', 'fail', 'see', 'red', 'sox', 'anywher', 'near', '.500', 'season']",0.34572490706319703,-1.0

2684,"I didn't grow up a Red Sox fan. Baseball was never really watched in my household, and if anything my dad was a O's fan. 2003 brought me into the fold by bringing all of New England close to the brink and then getting crushed. But that excitement... I was hooked. 2004 and all its majesty was the first full season I paid attention to the Red Sox, and from that moment forward I've been a die-hard Sox fan. 

One man was the glue the held it all together, the single most clutch hitter I will likely ever see, a man who not only brought the Sox their first win in 86 years but was a (if not -the-) cog in bringing home two more, the man who even as far back as AOL Instant Messenger was my favorite player as immortalized by the original nickname PapiPedroManny. Big Papi. The Large Father. David Ortiz.

One day when I'm old and grey I will regale my Sox loving grandchildren with stories of how the legend truly doesn't capture the man. How there was simply something different in the air when he came up to bat with the game on the line. How I got to see Ortiz live. How I got see Papi hit a home run. How when it came down to it, Papi always somehow had the well the never ran out to go to when the team needed him most. 

And I won't be alone. David was every kid who grew up with the Red Sox in the past decade's favorite player. It was practically a requirement. The Red Sox will move on. Even now with this loss they're in one of the best positions in baseball moving forward over the next five years, and look to build on this success with more from the core next year. But it won't be the same. Everything is different now.

The use of the word 'era' is one of the most overused terms in sports. If a player has a couple good years somewhere than leaves, it's inevitably the end of that guys era. But here, now, it's more than apropos. The David Ortiz Era has ended. The Era of The Idiots has ended. The team that brought the Red Sox back to World Series glory is now all gone. My childhood baseball team, my first team... it's over. I know now, even at 23, that nothing as special as these past dozen years of the David Ortiz Era will ever come to pass. Not for me.

So as one tiny Sox fan in a sea of Red, thank you Mr. Ortiz. You were, everything boiled down, the reason I became the baseball fan I am today. And that is a gift I can never repay.

1. You can't just be up there and just doin' a balk like that.

1a. A balk is when you

1b. Okay well listen. A balk is when you balk the

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The pitcher is not allowed to do a motion to the, uh, batter, that prohibits the batter from doing, you know, just trying to hit the ball. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the pitcher is in the stretch, he can't be over here and say to the runner, like, ""I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna tag you out! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to pitch and then don't pitch, you have to still pitch. You cannot not pitch. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, throwing motion of the ball, and then, until you just throw it.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have the ball up here, like this, but then there's the balk you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. Fairuza Balk hasn't been in any movies in forever. I hope she wasn't typecast as that racist lady in American History X.

1c-b(2)-b(i). Oh wait, she was in The Waterboy too! That would be even worse.

1c-b(2)-b(ii). ""get in mah bellah"" -- Adam Water, ""The Waterboy."" Haha, classic...

4720," Hello and welcome to the Rays subreddit, I am your friendly /r/TampaBayRays Moderator and heart-throb /u/RyeWhiskeyy. Allow me to be your guide on the epic journey that is Rays Baseball.

As some of you may or may not have known, The Rays have been playing professional baseball since the late 1900's. They are Located in St. Petersburg Fla, ( I know, I know, But St.Pete is in the Tampa Bay Area, so close enough, right?) a historic baseball community. They are owned by Stu Sternberg, a Wall street investor. Leading the front office are Matt Silverman and Eric Neander. With Coach Kevin Cash managing on the field.


For a guide to the previous 2018 season [read my toast from Toast from the baseball subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/al9yzo/a_toast_to_the_tampa_bay_rays/?) /r/Baseball, That is also a great sub if you haven't already.

Have a look at our [roster](http://m.rays.mlb.com/roster/) and familiarize yourself with some of our team. Some sub favorites are Tommy Pham, ji-Man Choi, Tyler Glasnow, Austin Meadows and Brandon Lower.

Now baseball is a game played between two teams of 9 players, When the offensive team comes up to bat, They have 3 chances or "" Outs"" to move players on to base and down the baseline.  They can reach base by getting a hit, getting walked ( When a pitcher throws 4 garbage pitches that the hitter doesn't swing at also known as ""Balls"") getting hit by a pitch, balk and there are a few others I guess but these are the important ones. Each individual batter can swing at the ball until they have either accumulated 3 swings that did not hit anything called "" strikes""or 4 balls, as we previously discussed. At this point, they are either get a hit, are out or take 1st base. Each team gets three outs per inning, and there are 9 innings, so be prepared to watch a game for at a minimum of at least 5 or 6 hours.

Now the defenses job is to Pitch the ball , that guys job is to throw nasty pitches, in the strike zone, or Umpires zone of bullshit, to strike out the other team. If the ball is hit into play, Its up to the fielders to field the ball and assist with getting the out by either catching the ball or throwing the ball to whatever base a offensive player is running too. Multiple outs can be gotten in a single play.

Anyways, that's enough explaining baseball to you, I know it seems complicated, but its not and you will understand it soon enough.  

Now the Rays play at a historic field named for a wonderful juice brand called Tropicana. You Lightning fans may know it as it was once home your hockey team. Well, a lot has changed since then and I can guarantee that there probably isn't any ice on the field anymore. Now, a lot of people like to talk shit about the Trop, They say its ugly and disgrace to baseball, so In that instance Rule number 1 is always Defend the Trop, I don't care if you hate it, It's ours and you are going to fucking like it. If any silly Yankees fan talks shit about the Trop and brags about the 27 rings their team won 2,000 years ago, tell them to shove it. Literally shove the Trop up there ass, Its spherical so it shouldn't be to hard.

So why should you bandwagon the Rays and not some other loser ass team? Well, The Rays are simply different. If you didn't know, The Rays have one of the lowest payrolls in baseball, they rely on atypical strategies like Openers, bullpenning, defensive shifts etc that baseball traditionalist hate. But fuck them. Not only are the Rays not afraid to try new things, but they are also fairly successful at it. After using these strategies to take a team predicted to win 60-ish games to competing for wild card spot, many people are looking at baseball differently as the Rays are at the forefront of baseball innovation. Gone are the days or peanuts and crackerjacks and getting sucked off underneath the right field bleachers. Today is about pulled pork nachos, petting stingrays in left field and Blake Snell streaming fortnite for some reason. You guys are privileged to  watch history in the making and by privileged I mean getting to watch Ryne Stanek (Crack Thor) get 30 game starts with only 50 innings pitched. 

I hope by now you guys have realized this post is a joke, so welcome to the subreddit and please don't forget to join our discord https://discord.gg/fNKTfgj and as always, Defend the Trop. I swear to god you need to physically threaten people if they talk shit about the Trop.",2019-04-17,['401074991'],TB,"['hello', 'welcom', 'ray', 'subreddit', 'friendli', '/r/tampabayray', 'moder', 'heart-throb', '/u/ryewhiskeyi', 'allow', 'guid', 'epic', 'journey', 'ray', 'basebal', 'may', 'may', 'known', 'ray', 'play', 'profession', 'basebal', 'sinc', 'late', '1900', 'locat', 'st.', 'petersburg', 'fla', 'know', 'know', 'st.pete', 'tampa', 'bay', 'area', 'close', 'enough', 'right', 'histor', 'basebal', 'commun', 'own', 'stu', 'sternberg', 'wall', 'street', 'investor', 'lead', 'front', 'offic', 'matt', 'silverman', 'eric', 'neander', 'coach', 'kevin', 'cash', 'manag', 'field', 'guid', 'previou', '2018', 'season', 'read', 'toast', 'toast', 'basebal', 'subreddit', 'http', '//old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/al9yzo/a_toast_to_the_tampa_bay_rays/', '/r/basebal', 'also', 'great', 'sub', ""n't"", 'alreadi', 'look', 'roster', 'http', '//m.rays.mlb.com/roster/', 'familiar', 'team', 'sub', 'favorit', 'tommi', 'pham', 'ji-man', 'choi', 'tyler', 'glasnow', 'austin', 'meadow', 'brandon', 'lower', 'basebal', 'game', 'play', 'two', 'team', 'player', 'offens', 'team', 'come', 'bat', 'chanc', 'out', 'move', 'player', 'base', 'baselin', 'reach', 'base', 'get', 'hit', 'get', 'walk', 'pitcher', 'throw', 'garbag', 'pitch', 'hitter', ""n't"", 'swing', 'also', 'known', 'ball', 'get', 'hit', 'pitch', 'balk', 'other', 'guess', 'import', 'one', 'individu', 'batter', 'swing', 'ball', 'either', 'accumul', 'swing', 'hit', 'anyth', 'call', 'strike', 'ball', 'previous', 'discuss', 'point', 'either', 'get', 'hit', 'take', '1st', 'base', 'team', 'get', 'three', 'out', 'per', 'inning', 'inning', 'prepar', 'watch', 'game', 'minimum', 'least', 'hour', 'defens', 'job', 'pitch', 'ball', 'guy', 'job', 'throw', 'nasti', 'pitch', 'strike', 'zone', 'umpir', 'zone', 'bullshit', 'strike', 'team', 'ball', 'hit', 'play', 'fielder', 'field', 'ball', 'assist', 'get', 'either', 'catch', 'ball', 'throw', 'ball', 'whatev', 'base', 'offens', 'player', 'run', 'multipl', 'out', 'gotten', 'singl', 'play', 'anyway', 'enough', 'explain', 'basebal', 'know', 'seem', 'complic', 'understand', 'soon', 'enough', 'ray', 'play', 'histor', 'field', 'name', 'wonder', 'juic', 'brand', 'call', 'tropicana', 'lightn', 'fan', 'may', 'know', 'home', 'hockey', 'team', 'well', 'lot', 'chang', 'sinc', 'guarante', 'probabl', ""n't"", 'ice', 'field', 'anymor', 'lot', 'peopl', 'like', 'talk', 'shit', 'trop', 'say', 'ugli', 'disgrac', 'basebal', 'instanc', 'rule', 'number', 'alway', 'defend', 'trop', ""n't"", 'care', 'hate', 'go', 'fuck', 'like', 'silli', 'yanke', 'fan', 'talk', 'shit', 'trop', 'brag', 'ring', 'team', '2,000', 'year', 'ago', 'tell', 'shove', 'liter', 'shove', 'trop', 'ass', 'spheric', ""n't"", 'hard', 'bandwagon', 'ray', 'loser', 'ass', 'team', 'well', 'ray', 'simpli', 'differ', ""n't"", 'know', 'ray', 'one', 'lowest', 'payrol', 'basebal', 'reli', 'atyp', 'strategi', 'like', 'open', 'bullpen', 'defens', 'shift', 'etc', 'basebal', 'traditionalist', 'hate', 'fuck', 'ray', 'afraid', 'tri', 'new', 'thing', 'also', 'fairli', 'success', 'use', 'strategi', 'take', 'team', 'predict', 'win', '60-ish', 'game', 'compet', 'wild', 'card', 'spot', 'mani', 'peopl', 'look', 'basebal', 'differ', 'ray', 'forefront', 'basebal', 'innov', 'gone', 'day', 'peanut', 'crackerjack', 'get', 'suck', 'underneath', 'right', 'field', 'bleacher', 'today', 'pull', 'pork', 'nacho', 'pet', 'stingray', 'left', 'field', 'blake', 'snell', 'stream', 'fortnit', 'reason', 'guy', 'privileg', 'watch', 'histori', 'make', 'privileg', 'mean', 'get', 'watch', 'ryne', 'stanek', 'crack', 'thor', 'get', 'game', 'start', 'inning', 'pitch', 'hope', 'guy', 'realiz', 'post', 'joke', 'welcom', 'subreddit', 'pleas', ""n't"", 'forget', 'join', 'discord', 'http', '//discord.gg/fnktfgj', 'alway', 'defend', 'trop', 'swear', 'god', 'need', 'physic', 'threaten', 'peopl', 'talk', 'shit', 'trop']",0.6059479553903345,-1.0

We had a lot of good players. 5 of us went on to play D-1 college ball. We had a great rivalry with a team named the Tidewater Drillers, out of Virginia, and got the better of them more than they got us. The Tidewater Drillers ""alumni"" includes Mark Reynolds, Chris Taylor, David Winfree, and Ryan Zimmerman. I played against Taylor, but I don't remember him the way I remember Jackie.

In my 2-3 years on this team, we didn't get beat often, however, we were run-ruled just one time, by the Richmond Braves. This team was a bunch of donkeys. Obviously, in teenage years, some kids grow faster than others, and in sports, that advantage can be huge. We had four or five of those. The Braves had 12. Except for one small black kid they put in centerfield. We figured he must be pretty good to be on this team, but he looked tiny next to his teammates. He's hitting lead off, and starts the game off by smacking a line-drive double to the warning track. This went on the entire game, and yes, we did get to see his arm from center. We got their big sticks out a few times, and handled the lineup pretty well. Except this CFer. He went 5-5 against us, with 3 or 4 doubles, and was hitting piss missiles every time. But this is what impressed me the most. This kid's running around the bases damn near every inning, he's chasing balls all over the outfield, and any time he wasn't doing that, he was outside the dugout, taking swings off a tee into a net. The entire game. Different drills. Different swings. Hitting to all fields. He was perfecting his craft in the middle of a game, at 14 years old. To this day, he's the only person I've seen do that. We ended up losing that game 10-0, which had never happened to us, and we couldn't even be mad about it. They all whooped our ass, but we were just amazed by that little CFer, more than anything else.

Fast forward a few years, and I was a walk-on at the University of South Carolina. I meet Jackie, and we get to talking. I knew he was from around my area, so I started asking him where he played, and came to realize, he was that CFer from all those years ago. And he hadn't changed. In that locker room, there were walk-ons like me that knew this was the last stop before beer league. There were guys with god-given ability that wasted it. There were guys you'd watch and think they've got a chance to make it to the show (Whit Merrifield, for one). And then there was JBJ. It was transcendent with him. He was going to make it to the Bigs. You could just tell by the way he played. The way he worked. The way he spoke. He was humble, hard-working, and quiet. Yet he still had this major league vibe about him, and you could feel that this just going to be a chapter to a very long career. He's a class act and a great personality, with great parents who came to every single weekend series. Off the field, he'd occasionally DD friends, but I don't think I ever saw him take a sip of alcohol. That had to have been hard to do with that team, in particular, and an SEC environment. He was a true professional from the very beginning.

On top of his approach to the game, his two national titles, CWS MOP, and his hitting, he has a fucking Howitzer attached to his torso, and he is far and away the best defensive centerfielder I've ever seen. He was going to the Show on his defense alone. He could hit .150 and he'd still be a tremendous late game replacement. I got to see it every day. I played a bit of corner outfield, but center is tough. Jackie knows where the ball is going to be as soon as it hits the bat. I've watched him do it thousands of times, and I can count on one hand how many times I've seen him misjudge a ball. I still don't know how he does it with that straight-on angle. His instincts are supernatural.

Anyways, to wrap this up, I've been so proud of him over the years, but this series was something else. From what I've seen out of Boston fans, you guys accept his hitting for what it is because of how damn good he is out there in the toughest outfield in baseball. I appreciate the love y'all have for him, and just wanted to share my personal experience as an insight to who Jackie is, and that he deserves to be ballin. He's always been a big-stage player, and I've been jumping out of my seat watching him this week. I'm rooting for y'all to win this shit. Go Sox!

4223,"I didn't understand and I still do not understand why the Yankees were ranked so high before the season in all that predictions. I mean, look at their offensive numbers this season (yesterday they had 3 players with a WRC+ &gt; 100 in their lineup), which are not even surprising to me. And that's even though a miracle happend and Judge and Stanton were healthy all the season. The rest of the lineup is just not good enough to win anything in the postseason. The Yankees had their 13 (?) games winning stretch, but outside of that they were to mediocre, so that there may be some Yankee fans questioning themselves how the Yankees could even make it to the WC game.

With that in mind I wasn't too surprised that we won (and especially how we did that) yesterday. Although their pitching was good this season (starting rotation was fine, bullpen was good), it was obvious that Cole had some struggles in the second half of the season. I am glad we pushed the right buttons offensively and added another big-time struggle to his list.

As we went with a slight advantage (in my opinion) in yesterday's game, we are obviously in the underdog role against the Rays.

I promised myself that I wouldn't check the score of their game even one single time, and the result is there for all of you to see! SWEEP!!! Needless to say, I won't be checking another Yankee score for the rest of the season.

It started with Aaron Judge. An obvious create-a-player. Max height, max weight, #99, badass name, and obviously maxed out stats all the way around. I‚Äôm pretty sure I created the exact character in MVP Baseball 2005.

FA comes around and this kid missed out on Harper AND Machado. So what does this kid do? He throws a temper tantrum and edits two random 55 overall scrubs to straight 99‚Äôs ‚Äî Gio Urshela and Mike Tauchman. Who needs Harper and Machado now?

The season starts and the kid starts simulating and two games in he has to cancel simulation because he lost TO THE FUCKING ORIOLES. Can‚Äôt let that happen again. NOPE. He‚Äôs played every game against the orioles since, manually, with difficulty set to beginner. FUCK the orioles, this kid says, as he smacks dinger after dinger against them.

The Red Sox need a new direction and fast in order to salvage a winning team and revamp this team as soon as next year.

So they need a GM with a more Cherington mindset now. Someone that's really good at getting prospects and building up a farm system. So that's the new direction we need to go in. Dombrowski isn't that so he's pointless to have at the top. 

This is the end of a never-ending cycle due to horrendous ownership. There's no consistency.

I write little elegies for retired sports folk a few times a year, but this one is the hardest yet. Without Big Papi, probably my greatest memory in life wouldn't exist. David Ortiz wasn't just an athlete. His words lifted me up when I could barely conceive happiness - (""This is our fucking city""). His smile, belief, and passion made every summer just a bit better. His story made me think that I could achieve anything if I worked hard enough. His dedication to not just the game, but to the community was enough to save lives.
It's stupid to feel so sad that you can't watch a millionaire play a relatively meaningless sport ever again, I get it. But to me, Big Papi feels like a friend. He feels like that guy that was there for you when you needed it the most, and without him, baseball can never be the same to me.

Thank you, Papi. In my most honest and sincere belief, thank you for everything. I don't think you could ever understand how much you'll be missed. Like I asked my relatives for stories about seeing Ted Williams play, I know I'll be telling stories of seeing you play for the rest of my life. You are truly one of the greats.

3694,"HOUSTON (AP) -- Researchers in Houston today announced a shocking discovery that has upended the scientific world. They say they have collected conclusive evidence that 13-year old Rafael Devers is the biological father of 36-year old Justin Verlander.

""This discovery upends everything we know about not only human biology but also the linear nature of time,"" said Solo Johnson, one of the researchers on the team that announced the discovery. ""But the data we have collected allows for no other conclusion.""

Researchers say they first became suspicious of Verlander's true paternity in October 2018 when Devers ""totally dad dicked"" Verlander in the ALCS. But their sample size at the time was too small to pass scientific muster.

Now they report further testing has confirmed their prior findings.

""After observing the young third baseman again assert his fatherly dominance at Verlander's own park, we can now say with 100 percent scientific certainty that Rafael Devers is Justin Verlander's biological father.""

Although earlier findings drew skeptics from across the scientific community, the researchers' latest findings have produced wide-spread consensus.

""At first I said, 'Are you kidding me?'"" recounted Stat Masterson, chair of the Bridgepiece Studies Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""But now it's a beautiful thing. I'm telling ya.""

2478,"Gary Sanchez has had one of the most up and down careers of any athlete in the last thirty years. When he is at his best he is shattering records, at his worst he can single-handedly lose you a series. Many of us thought that it was a lack of consistency, or maybe even a lack of effort after he experiences a deep run of success and he grows complacent; but is there something more here? Something deeper? Is his desire to avoid playing like ass simply a side effect of an even stronger desire for Booty?

Gary Sanchez made his MLB debut in 2015, going 0-2 in his first career game. He was given an opportunity to win the backup catcher role in 2016, that he lost to future brawling ally vs Miguel Cabrera Austin Romine. Gary was promoted for good finally on August 3rd, 2016.

In August of 2016, there were rumors flying that Jennifer Lopez, noted Yankees' fan and thickness ambassador, was on the outs in her relationship of 2 years with then-current boyfriend Casper Smart. On August 16th a report came out that they had split up, and Casper was seen out and about in Hollywood with Nicole Schezerzneeergniner of the Pussycat Dolls. Later that night Gary Sanchez posted the first two homer night of his career. He would go on to win AL Player of the Week, hitting .523 and winning Player of the Week the following week and Player of the Month. That season Gary became the first player in MLB history with at least 11 home runs and 31 hits in his first 23 career games, and became the fastest player in history to hit 19 home runs. Despite playing in less than 60 games, Gary nearly won the AL Rookie of the Year award. Was a desire to impress the now available Lopez what drove his Herculean effort to keep the 2016 Yankees relevant? 

Fast forward to 2017 and Gary is coming into the season with the weight of New York on his shoulders. He struggled mightily to start the year, and despite a strong enough rally to get himself a spot in the Allstar Game and Home Run Derby, he was fading hard by July and early August. Was it the expectations that wore him down? Or was it that Jlo had since found love in a former Yankee star in February, causing him to spiral?

Ironically, Gary's struggles only abated after he attended a dinner with mentor Alex Rodriguez, and, you guessed it, his current girlfriend Jennifer Lopez. Immediately following the dinner Gary hit .471 with three home runs the following 5 games, crediting Ms. Lopez with giving him ""Positive advice and a positive experience."" He also spoke of her as a great actress, a compliment as wide reaching and generous as an Angel Hernandez strike zone for one of the 11 pitchers left in baseball he doesn't hold contempt for. Gary would go on to win the 2017 Silver Slugger for Catcher.

As injuries reached him, as well as time away from Jennifer while she strengthened her bond with Arod, Gary suffered a terrible 2018. Gary had a bounce back 2019, hitting 34 home runs and benefiting from a much healthier season and a trimmer body, though some experts, (I guess just me, so *all* experts), speculate that his renewed power came from renewed hope after an April bombshell by Jose Conseco revealed potential cheating rumors that threatened the union of the abbreviation power couple of Arod and Jlo.

In 2020 Arod and Jlo doubled down on their wedding, saying it was coming, just delayed due to the pandemic. This possibly triggered one of the worst seasons in Yankees' baseball history, including a .147 average and -0.3 War in just 49 games.

Gary came into camp of 2021 in good shape again, and did have a good first two games before slumping again. Hope arrived, however, in the second half of April in the form of the announcement of Arod and Jen's separation. Gary finished his April batting .190, then batted .213 with four homers in May, followed by a June where his is currently batting over .300 for the month with six home runs and 13 RBI's, with a week still remaining.

Further studies will need to be conducted with the return of Dare Devil and noted Red Sox lover Ben Afflec into her life, but as a Yankees' fan Jeniffer Lopez needs to truly ask herself; is a fling with an ex really worth throwing away one of the greatest hitting catchers of all time? Would her time not be better spent in the arms of a younger man who could give her not only the wedding ring that has alluded her for so long, but a World Series ring powered by love?

&gt;In sensing my presence, he let out a great bellow. 

&gt;I said, ""EASY THERE, DELLIN""

&gt;And then, as i watched him throw warmup tosses, I noticed something was obstructing his breathing.

&gt;Where i was standing, i was able to see STRAIGHT into the eye of the great starter (reliever, whatever).

&gt;All the sudden, something led me to the mound and i was right face to face with his mouth. 

&gt;I can barely see from beer cans being tossed down on top of me, but i knew something was there. 

&gt;So i reached my hand in, felt around and PULLED out the obstruction.

For all we know, Morton would have given up a couple extra runs if he was kept in against the Astros. His managerial style is based on making decisions that often feel wrong but, on average, work out better than just instinct. Overall, the strategy works, *and there's no perfect way of predicting when it won't*.

I still lean on this being a bad decision *given the match-up that he was taken out for*, but people are over-reacting so much.

No, I'm not surprised by an 0-3 start, but hear me out...

In a lot of pre-season projections, the Red Sox were consistently projected to reach 80-83 wins. USA Today pegged them at 80-82, CBS Sports had them at 79.5 (round to 80 for the sake of argument), and PECOTA estimated 79.8 (again, round to 80) wins.

I just don't see our hated rivals hovering around .500 at all this season. Verdugo, Martinez, Bogaerts and Devers do create a formidable heart of the order, but who else in their lineup can hit? Kike Hernandez is the only other notable name in their lineup, and he has a career .735 OPS.

I don't need to go into detail about the rotation, especially since Sale could be out until any point between May and August. Eduardo Rodriguez is a slightly above average pitcher when healthy, but that's about it.

The bullpen? Matt Barnes isn't that good, and Ottaviano cannot flourish in high-leverage situations or tight games. The rest of their bullpen is makeshift.

Maybe I'll end up being wrong, but I fail to see how the Red Sox will be anywhere near .500 this season.‚Äù

Tell us what sold you on the opportunity to come to Baltimore? What did Mike Elias tell you, what did the Angelos brothers tell you, what did you see in this team and its potential that made you want to get in on the ground floor?

I imagine you‚Äôre still in the process of making calls and booking flights, but the Orioles are a team depleted of lots of veterans, lots of talent, from Hardy to Machado to Gausman to Jones. While the Orioles have no realistic shot at a pennant next year, leadership is key to developing the talent to get it some years from now. Is there somebody on the roster who you see as being The Guy (whether you‚Äôre ready to name him or not) and/or is there somebody you and Elias might sign or trade for to be The Guy?

Before putting pen to paper, did you seek counsel from Joe Maddon or any of your peers across the league? While I understand some conversations between friends you‚Äôll want to remain between friends, what was a bit of advice you got from somebody that stuck out to you?

The Orioles of 2019 are very much a blank slate, but they‚Äôre a franchise with a rich past, one commemorated in bronze, etched into the pavement and personified in Brooks Robinson, who you got to meet Monday. While I don‚Äôt expect you to be able to name everybody who put on the uniform or commiserate over the annus horribilis of 2005, tell us about something either from over the course of your career outside the organization or your several days inside it that struck you about the history of baseball in Baltimore.

I‚Äôve spent 16 professional seasons in various coaching positions, including as the Chicago Cubs director of player development. Most recently, I served as the bench coach for the Cubs. I was a part of the team who helped bring winning baseball back to Chicago, including a World Series title in 2016.

On one hand, O's fans have been frustrated in recent memory with the way young pitchers have been handled in the organization; for the most part that manifests from the track records of our pitching prospects at the major league level. We've seen quite a few pitchers drafted by the O's who have gone elsewhere and had greater success, and there is a feeling that this reflects poorly on the minor league staff to date.

On the other hand, there are other components to the player development puzzle, some of which can be handed down from the highest levels of the organization, some of which can be solved by scouting and selecting players with specific skillsets which fit into an overall philosophy.

My questions are: How much do you value continuity in the staff at the minor league level in the player development process?

I don't know if you guys know this, but in the Dominican there were no Red Sox fans in the 90s. It was all Yankees, but Pedro and Papi changed that forever.

I remember that ALCS. I remember all the Yankee fans at school giving me shit all day after game 3. I remember the papers saying we were done.

I remember game 4, but most of all I remember game 5. God, I loved that headline. It said ""THE YANKEES' BIG FATHER"" in Spanish, and the photo of David rounding first after that game winning hit in the 14th inning. It was awesome after hearing Pedro call the Yankees his daddy, and all the bullshit that came of that, have David be called the Yankees' daddy all by himself. 

I remember '07. It cemented the idea that the curse was really over. That '04 wasn't a fluke. That we could win championships for real, and often.

Then there's 2013. Man, what can I say about that? The island literally stopped to watch Big Papi fucking crush that postseason. Nobody missed 1 second of 1 game.

I recall watching that ALCS grand slam at my father's house. Bases loaded... ""what if he hits a homer now? Could you imagine? That'd be crazy."" And BOOM! TIE GAME!

I remember running into him at the gym every off season. The man worked out every day like he had some baseball to play in December. We were doing bench press right next to each other once, and he said hi to me like we'd been friends for years ""Que lo que mi hermano?"", smiled and hugged me. If you wanna call him a celebrity, he's the nicest one on the planet, by far.

I ran into him on the elevator once before that, and I asked him why he worked out so hard in December, and he said it's the only way to stay in shape for March. ""Old guys don't have the luxury of vacations"" 

I hope I run into him again when I'm down there for Christmas. Part of me finds solace in the fact that I'll get to see him from time to time, but I'm mostly sad that we won't be seeing him walk up to the plate and put on that beautiful show.

We'll miss you, big man. Thanks for the memories. We'll cherish them forever.

I've been an Orioles fan as long as I can remember. I think my earliest memories go back to 1964 and I was fortunate to have my early fan years intersect some of the Orioles strongest seasons. I'm hoping for a new resurgence.

I've got some thoughts on alternatives to the traditional five-man rotation, ones that leverages many short stints by middle relievers instead of relying on long outings by ""starters.""  I've written up a brief summery. It's called ""The Nine-man Rotation."" It's only a few pages, but I believe it effectively covers the concept.  I'd be honored if you would have the time to read it.

\- Your approach seems to be based on the level of risk associated with a pick, a signing, etc.

  \- In the example of a high school pitcher being a #1 draft pick, I would assume you look at it being a higher risk than a college pitcher simply because there are more variables involved in them being successful.

1. The Orioles haven't had a pitching ace since Mike Mussina (aside from one year of Erik Bedard).

Considering many of our top prospects have dealt with injury issues and have complained (once elsewhere) that the Orioles messed with their mechanics, I wonder if there's something wrong.

284,"Hello Mike,

I'm a bit late to the party, as many questions without replies have stacked up, but wish to pose a question about analytics with regard to a hitter's approach at the plate. 

From watching Oriole hitters recently, especially this past season, there seemed to be a take the first pitch approach with some, while others would be more aggressive (looking at Machado and Jones here even though they are with other teams) at the plate. 

My question becomes thus, would analytics dictate an aggressive approach to a pitcher with a high first pitch strike percentage, and conversely, taking a more cautious approach with a low first pitch strike percentage? Or does it depend on the number of pitches/type of pitches/frequency of use for each pitch that dictates a hitter's thinking at the plate?

I ask because much of the lineup appeared lost, especially with off-speed and breaking balls.

Mookie Betts has amassed **35.2** career WAR. Per my calculations, **35.2** &gt; **32.2**. Mookie Betts is worth more than two full teams-worth of Major League Baseball players, don't look into that, it's verifiable and I have the numbers to prove it so let's just move on.

It's even better when we restrict it to just the 5th round: compared to Mookie's 35.2, the rest of that 5th round draft class has produced 3.1 career war. Combined. Mookie's accumulated more than 10x as much WAR as every other player taken in that round put together.

First and foremost: thank you. I honestly cannot recall a decision that has gotten this fanbase as unanimously excited as this one has. You've filled us with hope and while we know there is a long road ahead, we're behind you.

My questions:

1. Knowing the state of the organization, do you see the Orioles being active whatsoever in Free Agency?
2. 2019 will be the first time you've had the #1 draft pick since you took Correa/Appel/Aiken in 2012-14. Can you give us any thoughts about what you're going to do with the first overall pack in the 19 draft?

2742,"David Ortiz changed my life and I'll always carry him with me. I grew up as an American expat in New Delhi,  India and clung fiercely to baseball and the few Nickelodeon VHS tapes my parents brought over. For a while, baseball and pop culture were really the only ties to my American identity beyond my parents. Outside of occasional games on summer road trips through the US, I didn't have the chance to watch or truly follow a Major League Baseball team until ESPN Star Sports started airing NESN and YES games at 530 in the morning. For a kid, the Idiots were a fun, easy choice over the stoic Yankees. The 2003 postseason broke my heart, but cemented my status as a Red Sox fan for life. After FINALLY making it to my first Red Sox game in 2007, I knew I was home. Papi and Manny each homered. The air was so thick with excitement and energy, you knew the ball was bound to hang up in the zone. 

Thanks to Large Father, I applied only to schools in  Boston, was lucky enough to live across the Pike on Newbury Street so I could wake up to Fenway every morning and felt like I had been a Bostonian all my life, soaking in the game day buzz from my porch. I even went to more than 50 games during the Bobby Valentine train wreck just to watch Papi react to every little change in the game. 

Thanks to Papi, I picked a great University that helped my startup grow semi pro and youth baseball in India. Seeing what baseball did for him keeps me going every day. His energy and joy for baseball has been in my bones since I used to get up for games every morning, too thrilled to be sleepy. There's talent in India. There's unbridled love for baseball in players here. I know that if Papi could have gone from a kid who just wanted to have fun to Boston's favorite son, so could so many of the wonderful Indian kids I see take the field every day. 

I cried like a baby in front of my players watching Marco come in for Ortiz during our morning practice yesterday. When I looked up, however, I couldn't help but smile. I saw more than 30 Indian teens, some gutted at the red sox loss, some in my face gloating that we won't have the AL's best offense anymore, and others still  talking about the Nats chances and how they think the hot stove season will play out. If it weren't for David Ortiz, I may have never held onto that passion for baseball and we may have never started our pipe dream baseball league here. No matter whether we develop India's first major leagues or simply maintain a fun youth league, I feel so moved that a single player with a booming voice, wide smile and deadly bat could change so many lives 8000 miles from Fenway. 

I love you David.

1. We have Groshans in the pipe (ETA 2022).
2. We have Orelvis Martinez in the pipe (ETA 2023).
3. We have Otto Lopez in the pipe (ETA 2022). 
4. We have a MLB ready stopgap in Biggio.
5.  There is some scuttle that Moreno could convert to 3rd. Bat is major league ready. Jansen and Kirk are good players. 

Given that we have a budget, it really doesn't make much sense to spend what we need to spend on Semien. He's a luxury and we need to save for necessity.

From just a value perspective I think this is a solid deal for the Rays (obviously it‚Äôs bad for baseball that things like this happen, but if you‚Äôre gonna move Snell this is a good return for him), but I feel the need to chime in because I think OP is setting some unrealistic expectations for the return. Patino is a great prospect who has a ton of potential, but this post isn‚Äôt accurately portraying how developed he is. Tbh I doubt he‚Äôll see much of any major league action next year, it was pretty obvious watching the Padres last season that we rushed him up (which we do a lot tbh). His control was really bad last year and his secondaries need some extra development too, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll have too much trouble working his pitches and his control should approach league average as he gets a feel for his entire arsenal. The only thing that worried me about him is his height and that‚Äôs just because he reminds me of Anderson Espinoza (as a short pitcher with a ton of velocity). Mejia, at least imo, is the 4th guy in this trade. He was already starting to show signs of decline when we traded for him and that hasn‚Äôt slowed at all. He‚Äôs not a very good fielder behind the plate so most his value is in his bat which has been dead for the past few years. Wilcox is the prototypical second half of the first round pick, he‚Äôs got electric stuff but he needs to work on making better use of it (he‚Äôs very hittable rn which makes a lot of people think he‚Äôll be a reliever). Hunt is actually the sleeper guy in this trade and I know a lot of Padres fans have been buzzing about him.

4405,"I know many of you will probably yeet me out the window before you read the entirety of this post, but fellow baseball nerds, please hear me out!

Let me start out by saying that I was NOT a fan of Cash pulling Snell in THAT scenario. Snell was locked in, and visibly, his stuff was as sharp as it had been from pitch 1. Even though Betts has an .892 career OPS against him, the Rays BP had been anything but reliable to that point in the series, and that is especially pronounced with how poorly Anderson had been pitching all postseason.

HOWEVA...let me get into why the Rays just fleeced the Padres. You guys, as a fanbase, enjoy being a *very* competitive team year in and year out, right? There is a very poignant reason for why you guys are able to do that. Speaking as a Tigers fan, who has seen his team become an abomination due to a formerly, chronically barren farm system and inexhaustible spending on players well past their prime, I am green with envy at your front office, and frankly, your shrewd ownership. Yes, Stu is a dick. Yes, I would be furious with the veiled and not-so-veiled allusions to moving the team. Yes, it would be very annoying to see your favorite team be the baseball version of Ebenezer Scrooge, while everyone knows they could easily afford a high-tier payroll.

But THE main reason the Rays remain competitive year in and year out is because of moves like this: trading big leaguers at their peak or right when they start their decline, and relying on their renowned player development and scouting to expedite these supplemental prospects to the Bigs to backfill lost production. Hording cost-controlled prospects on a mass scale allows the team to be extremely well-balanced for years. This gives the team options: Options on when to spend for a FA to fill a hole, options to spend big on a short term trade to make a run at a WS, etc. You guys know this. I'm preaching to the choir.

I know Snellzilla is a fan favorite. I know you probably think he just got dealt for some slapdick prospects, and now he's riding away from you on a trusty steed into the horizon. Blake is on the decline though. Please take a breath as you feel your blood pressure rise from reading that. I say this because of a few reasons:

First, very real durability concerns. I mean this from both a health and inefficiency perspective. Blake is known as an ""Ace"" right? What is the #1 criteria for an Ace? It's arguably dependability, right? What makes a pitcher dependable? I would argue that it's taking the mound every 5th day, and going deep into games, consistently. What is the widely-accepted, blanket number for SP durability? That 30 start threshold, right? Snell has eclipsed the 30 start threshold a grand total of *once* in his career. And he hasn't even hit the mid-high 20's in those other years.  How about the games he does start? 

Of the 108 starts in Blake Snell's career, he has eclipsed:

6 innings: only 43 times

7 innings: only *13* times

8 innings: ZERO times

I don't know about you, but when I think of ""Aces,"" I think of guys like JV, Mad Max, Kershaw, Cole, etc. These are guys who you constantly see grinding into the 7th-9th innings because they pitch so well and so efficiently up to that point in the game that they make their managers' decisons easy. And these are guys who have played for managers and clubs that are *very* analytically-inclined. 

Now WAIT! Wait. I know what you're thinking. ""Well Snell doesn't go deep into games because Cash pulls him so quickly."" Well, let's trust Kevin Cash here. This is a man who is very, very well-regarded amongst his peers who are at the pinnacle of their profession. These are men and women who are so good and smart at what they do, that they get paid MILLIONS of dollars for their services in an uber-competitive industry, while leading teams of Ivy League data scientists and statisticians. Kevin Cash knows what he's doing. You think he would habitually take Snell out of games early on a whim? On the ""eyetest""? Just because he feels his taint starting to tickle? 

This is where Snell stans would normally tout his amazing surface level stats and awards. ""He's got a career 3.24 ERA! He's struck out 648 batters in 556 innings! He won the 2018 CY!"" Yes, but baseball is a ""What have you done for me lately?"" kinda profession. Teams evaluate, pay, and trade players based on projections; on what they hypothesize a player will do in the *future*, not necessarily only what was done in years past. Or at least that's how good teams operate (Looking at you, Tigers-pre-rebuild.)

Can't at least part of that sparkly bottom line be attributed to Cash's wisdom and savvy decision-making in taking him out before those numbers got any worse? Snell's velocity has fallen 10 percentile in the past 2 seasons. His batted ball profile has gotten much worse. His vertical and horizontal movement have receded rather dramatically on all of his pitches except his curveball horizontally, which is probably not even a good thing. 

Blake Snell is a good pitcher though! But the way the Rays deployed him made him even better. Is he an Ace? No, I don't think so. Is he a top 30 SP in baseball? Yes, I think so. Does the arbitrary title of ""Ace"" even mean anything substantive? No, probably not.

Back to the trade though. The best part of this deal for the Padres is Snell's relative team-friendly contract over the next 3 years (10.5, 12.5, 16). The Rays likely backloaded this deal because they knew his decline was inevitable, and that they would trade him anyways. I think they traded him at the peak of his value. What better time than after his masterful WS performance? Him being a lefty also greatly balances out a Padres rotation that just lost Clevy, and already has an overrated-Paddack, a fragile Lamet, a BABIP-friendly Davies, and an unproven or largely meh remainder of potential starters to choose from.

HOWEVA, the Rays get back the #3, 7, and 14 prospects (MLB.com) from a premiere SD farm system, as well as a very toolsy 25 year old, switch-hitting catcher with MLB experience, who was once a top prospect himself not too long ago. Don't you trust the Rays Player Development system to turn Mejia around? I sure do. He'll be the perfect platoon with Zunino. Heck, with the way pitchers peak and plummet so dramatically these days, Patino could be better than Snell as soon as THIS season! Patino is gushing with talent. Cole Wilcox is yet another behemoth for the Rays to tinker with, who can hit triple digits and has two plus offspeed offerings. Does that fit their specialty or what? Hunt adds to their plethora of catching depth; a position that is notorious for having prospects not pan out, or at least not pan out for long.

And the amazing thing is that Snell is expendable for the Rays! Even with losing him and Uncle Chuck, the Rays still have absurd pitching depth in their rotation and bullpen.

This is exactly the type of strategy, pragmatism, and ideology that keeps the Rays raysin'. You guys will be more than fine. You will thrive for the next decade.

Commence the pitchforks and run me out of town, back to /r/motorcitykitties!

3812,"I feel like the Sox strongly outperformed my expectations this regular season. After last year's 24-36 (.400 win %) fiasco, I hoped they could rebound to be a 500 ball club. Best case scenario, I saw 85 wins, which would have been a 20 win improvement if you project 2020 to a full 162 game season. 20 win improvements are super rare.

This year's team found ways to win a lot of games that appeared lost in the late innings. Of course the bullpen or lack of clutch hitting or bonehead base running led to a few late losses, but over 162 games all teams are going to deal with some of that.

Offensively, I had more hope than the OP. I felt Martinez was going to have a solid bounce back year. Without that, 500 ball isn't going to happen. Devers/Bogaerts, given where they are in their careers I think you can expect something in the very good to excellent range offensively under pretty much any scenario you can draw up. I've liked Verdugo since day 1 with the club. I think he's just developing into the kind of player he can be. 2020 was really his first year as an everyday player. That's the kind of player who can go either way - improve into a core part of the lineup or regress as the league figures out how to beat him. Solid progress.

Coming into the season I would have rated Renfroe higher than the OP seems to. He'd really only had 1 very good season in his career so far, 2018, but stepped up big time in an everyday role. I thought he'd be more of a platoon player. Had no idea how good he can be in RF.

Kike Hernandez and Christian Arroyo, I'd say both exceeded my expectations. They both came in as solid major leaguers. But so did Marwin Golzalez and Franchy Cordero (more limited sample size there). Win some, lost some...

Vazquez, I expected a better season offensively. 2019 and 2020 were solid. 23 HRs in 2019, 7 in essentially 1/3 of a full season last year. he ended up with an OB% that was pretty much a career low, and a Slugging % down over 100 points compared to the last 2 years. Sadly, he's kind of the JB Jr spot in the lineup now, albeit with a a little better OB% and worse power numbers. I'd have liked to have see Plawecki in more often.

Dalbec, didn't expect much out of him one way or the other, too raw a player to have a feel for what you can expect going into this season. Overall I think the Sox got solid production out of him.

Going into the season, based on what I wrote above, I felt they had made some potentially good offensive upgrades from the 2020 team, but they needed some bounces to go their way.",2021-10-04,[],BOS,"['feel', 'like', 'sox', 'strongli', 'outperform', 'expect', 'regular', 'season', 'last', 'year', '24-36', '.400', 'win', 'fiasco', 'hope', 'could', 'rebound', '500', 'ball', 'club', 'best', 'case', 'scenario', 'saw', 'win', 'would', 'win', 'improv', 'project', '2020', 'full', '162', 'game', 'season', 'win', 'improv', 'super', 'rare', 'year', 'team', 'found', 'way', 'win', 'lot', 'game', 'appear', 'lost', 'late', 'inning', 'cours', 'bullpen', 'lack', 'clutch', 'hit', 'bonehead', 'base', 'run', 'led', 'late', 'loss', '162', 'game', 'team', 'go', 'deal', 'offens', 'hope', 'felt', 'martinez', 'go', 'solid', 'bounc', 'back', 'year', 'without', '500', 'ball', ""n't"", 'go', 'happen', 'devers/bogaert', 'given', 'career', 'think', 'expect', 'someth', 'good', 'excel', 'rang', 'offens', 'pretti', 'much', 'scenario', 'draw', ""'ve"", 'like', 'verdugo', 'sinc', 'day', 'club', 'think', 'develop', 'kind', 'player', '2020', 'realli', 'first', 'year', 'everyday', 'player', 'kind', 'player', 'either', 'way', 'improv', 'core', 'part', 'lineup', 'regress', 'leagu', 'figur', 'beat', 'solid', 'progress', 'come', 'season', 'would', 'rate', 'renfro', 'higher', 'seem', 'realli', 'good', 'season', 'career', 'far', '2018', 'step', 'big', 'time', 'everyday', 'role', 'thought', 'platoon', 'player', 'idea', 'good', 'kike', 'hernandez', 'christian', 'arroyo', 'say', 'exceed', 'expect', 'came', 'solid', 'major', 'leaguer', 'marwin', 'golzalez', 'franchi', 'cordero', 'limit', 'sampl', 'size', 'win', 'lost', '...', 'vazquez', 'expect', 'better', 'season', 'offens', '2019', '2020', 'solid', 'hr', '2019', 'essenti', '1/3', 'full', 'season', 'last', 'year', 'end', 'pretti', 'much', 'career', 'low', 'slug', '100', 'point', 'compar', 'last', 'year', 'sadli', 'kind', 'spot', 'lineup', 'albeit', 'littl', 'better', 'wors', 'power', 'number', 'like', 'see', 'plawecki', 'often', 'dalbec', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'one', 'way', 'raw', 'player', 'feel', 'expect', 'go', 'season', 'overal', 'think', 'sox', 'got', 'solid', 'product', 'go', 'season', 'base', 'wrote', 'felt', 'made', 'potenti', 'good', 'offens', 'upgrad', '2020', 'team', 'need', 'bounc', 'way']",0.6022304832713755,0.0

* We came back down 4 against the Yankees when we were getting no hit.
* We eliminated the Yankees.
* We eliminated the Rays.
* We won 92 games in a division where 4 teams won 90 games or more.
* We saved our farm system instead of mortgaging it for one season like in 2018.
* We have Marcelo Maier.
* Garrett Whitlock and Tanner Houck will be in the rotation next year.
* Nate Eovaldi became an ace.
* We set records for Grand Slams in the playoffs.
* We had the most comeback wins in the league.
* We got through the last 2 months without a closer.
* The crowds at Fenway this year, especially in the playoffs, were absolutely insane.

5964,"Kitchenaid Stand Mixers are pricey, but I think they're worth it.  

With your old hand mixer on it's way out, and no replacement in sight, now is the time to make a splash on the free agent market and add a top-end mixer to your baking line up.   Some people may agree with Paul Beeston and prefer not to hand out long term deals, but I like the idea of locking down a mixer like the Kitchenaid Stand Mixer for 10+ years, even if it does cost $500.  

I'm not a numbers expert, but I'd expect you to be able to get 8-10 DAR (Desserts Above Replacement) for at least your first 5 years with the mixer.  Numbers may start to decline slowly after that, but the mixer should preform well even into the late stages of it's career.  

I know these mixers come in a variety of colours, but I'd suggest something neutral.  If you're faced with a complete kitchen rebuild in the coming years, you'd want the Kitchenaid mixer to fit in with it's new surroundings.  The trade market will be limited for a big ticket item like this.

With that data in hand your could potentially cross-reference against other competing off-brand mixers, and judge whether you would indeed get value from that type of item as opposed to a Kitchenaid. 

If you're working in the kitchen for seven months a year and baking moderately then you may not need to spend as much money on a high end item. If you're going to be baking at a high level for 9 months of the year then maybe it's worth investing in your kitchen items.

6154,"Probably the most crazy superstitious day ever for me as a baseball fan.

I'm not usually superstitious but while watching Game 1, I just couldn't shake the feeling that I *knew* the Jays would win if I just stopped watching. They were down 7-2, I had some stuff to do so I turned off the TV and went to my PC. Within moments I saw the Jays were now at 5 runs so I just left it be. A few times I'd see the Jays get people on base so I caved a few times and flipped the game on and I'd immediately see the rally killed. I decided to just stay away. The Jays eventually came back to win 11-10.

For Game 2, I had the opposite feeling. I felt like I *needed* to watch for them to win. I went back to the living room, laid down and got comfortable. Suddenly, the fire alarm goes off in my building. Normally I ignore it because we usually get a lot of false alarms but within moments we could hear people shouting from downstairs outside that there's a fire and people need to get out.

Me and my wife run downstairs and pretty much just wait around with the other tenants while the fire trucks come in and battle the fire. When the firemen finally start wrapping up their equipment and the stress is down, I pop open my at-bat app to see the Jays are being no hit. So I say screw it, top of the order coming up. I turn on MLB.TV and about 30 seconds later, Vladdy breaks up the no-hitter. I've been watching since.

You know what...fuck it.

YES, they are awesome mixers but like you said, IF you do a good amount of baking, and have attachments for cooking.  THAT said, you can very often find them on sale at a pretty decent deal, say around $200 - $300 or less depending on the model (like if you don't go for one of the professional series ones.)  So if you wait for a good sale (say, Black Friday or boxing week), and do a moderate amount of baking, it's pretty worth it.  In fact, for the long haul, if you do only a light amount of baking, it is also worth it.  Because then you have it, and when you want to make pancakes, cakes, cupcakes or cookies or *whatever*, you have it, you whip it out, it does a fantastic job for you, then goes back into storage, waiting to be used again.

Future Shop used to have a sale on the mixers plus their attachments every year (attachments were like 50% off), that coincided with an annual rebate period KitchenAid would have for the mixers and attachments.  So you could get one of the mixers on sale and a few attachments, and get another $50 or so back in rebates.  RIP Future Shop.  I'm not sure if Best Buy has continued the tradition or not.

Or look for clearance sales at places like Costco.ca, and you may find one being discontinued massively discounted.  I got a pretty decent one, middle of the road in their model lineup, on clearance for over 50% off, so it was under $200, a few years ago.  It's rock solid, but, it also only gets light usage.

Back before the 2000's (not sure about 2000's themselves) all models used to be made with metal gears.  Now they are made with a heavy plastic (not sure about the pro series).  This was a point of issue for people who had their mixers for like 30 - 40 years, and were disappointed when replacing them.  However, if you are not a heavy duty baker, then this probably won't be an issue for you ever. 

ATTACHMENTS

I have the ice cream maker and pasta roller attachments.  Both are pretty wicked.  Back when I used to have more time, I loved making home made pasta.  Fresh home made pasta is damned delicious.  And the texture is so nice.  Puts packaged pasta to shame.  I envy people who have their nonna living with them.  

Home made ice cream is also amazing.  Right when you finish making it, you basically have soft serve ice cream and it's so damn good (the more cream the merrier).  Then you put it in the freezer, and it's more like regular ice cream again...but if you take it out and let it sit for 5 minutes, it's back to being like soft serve again.  Mmmmm....  Also being able to make your own flavours is very cool.  Made pumpkin ice cream around thanksgiving a few times...wow.


Also, if this was a shitpost...then....damn you.

If it wasn't, then, I hope this helped!
